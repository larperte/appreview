A Google user,"I completely love this game! I maxed out everything in the 3rd hotel, even though all scuba gear said 0% towards my next star, it still gave me the 5th star. The 4th hotel shows 0% on the disco facility too. As a side note, the game is painfully slow without taking advantage of ads, and full of moments where there's no where near enough money for even the most basic items.",4,730,1.2.0
A Google user,"I've enjoyed a lot of titles from this developer but the monetization is getting worse and worse. It's always been pretty heavy, but this is ridiculous. Especially only getting 10 minutes of 2x per ad (usually just under a minute long)... If you have more patience than me, by the time you've watched enough for 2 hours, you need to watch an extra ad to top it up to a full bar! Very excessive.",2,582,1.1.1
A Google user,The game is great. Can easily spend time on it. But to make it less annoying you will have to pay a small amount to get rid of the ads otherwise it becomes very annoying. Another things that can be looked at is the logistics. Some services the guests have to spend at least 30 mins to reach and hence most of them don't reach on time. The event hotels the Housekeeping keeps on zigzagging due to the room numbering system leading to unnecessary rooms not clean messages.,4,575,1.7.1
A Google user,"I really like the game. It's a bit challenging to manage the money, but all over it's great. Some feedback: 1) the couple doesn't sit together to eat 2) the ad placement avoids the notch area and leaves it empty 3) the status bar for money is coming under the notch bar 4) guests go all the way to the exit and then come back to the front desk while checking out",4,505,1.1.0
A Google user,"It's a very good game! It haves a pretty high and interesting stuff, it is one lf the best tycoons, it's pretty good and it got most of the best things that other's don't have, The only problem i see is the high price for upgrading the Main Generator, and the batteries, which is very powerful but still, it doesn't even cover like enough upgrades to get a good price for the room. Well, this game is still very good and haves every property that could even get this to the best. tycoon. game. ever.",5,482,1.2.1
Garry Masol,"It's unique. This is the first hotel tycoon game I've seen with such unique graphics. It looks good, it feels good. It's awesome! However, i do have a complaint about the sensitivity, the game doesn't respond to my touches/taps sometimes when im in a room, if i press the left/right arrows the game suddenly doesn't recognize any input. If you could fix that, that would be great!",5,462,1.8.4
A Google user,"Simple but fun game, watching ads is completely your choice, no annoying popups occur. It's very satisfying to upgrade everything in your hotels, and it's playable without spending any money (I personally think that 11_ for all-time ads-free bonuses would be a bit expensive though). And the support is THE fastest support I've ever encountered. Not even a minute later I had all the answers to my problem. Keep up the good work! ____ Edit: Santa's shelter seems a bit lazy (just a bigger Codinental)",4,437,1.3.0
Ali Boop,"A fun game, I understand the issues with ads but it's better than most games of its kind. I've seen way worse. I did buy no ads and it's worked so far. Each hotel presents more of a challenge and more effort. which is fair. It does take a lot to get started. Though a tip. If you buy no ads you can boost your double money without watching an ad for it. which really helps.",5,388,1.8.4
A Google user,"The game is very unbalanced. Watching ads gives much more money than playing, so to move forward you pretty much only need to watch ads. Everything else you upgrade is pointless. If you don't watch ads , progress is unreasonably slow. The ads are too intrusive in terms of the playing experience too. Every two minute or so there's a loud sound and a guy start dancing in your hotel's lobby, until you either watch the ad or dismiss it.",1,382,1.2.0
A Google user,"Really enjoyed it up until unlocking the last hotel. The design seemed rushed and not well thought out. The layout is messy, cluttered and not appealing. I paid for stars that I used and upon reopening the game, the items I purchased had disappeared and the stars were not returned. Disappointed that this is the culmination of my time and money.",2,339,1.2.0
A Google user,"This is the first time I've ever played a game and caught up to the developers. I love that we have the option to pay a one time cost and remove all ads. I love to support the developers and that way I'm not constantly buying small upgrades... Tedious. Love this game. Brilliant, and super cute. I love watching the people roam the hotel and use the various facilities there! The animations are great.",5,327,1.3.0
A Google user,"Wow, this game is so much fun! Its so addicting. It is so easy to get lots of money in this game, all you do is ask the dancing king! I think thats halarious __. You also get money while offline, thats actually a really great perm. The animation in the game,in my opinion is really nice, well, other than you can kind of see the private areas.__ ITS NOT THAT BAD...Its also really cool that you can get different hotels and fully upgrade them all. Download this app! You won't regret it!",5,327,1.2.0
A Google user,"Pretty terrible. Seen a review saying you dont have to watch the ads, but... you do. The point of the game is watching ads, you can't play without unless you want to sit for hours watching nothing happen. It could have been made into an awesome game, but I didnt expect an ad suggestion every five minutes that if I don't accept a 30 second video I will start losing :') So cheap and awful....",2,326,1.2.2
Patrick Coleman,"If you want a game that is as realistic as can be expected, then this is it! I've had nothing but fun challenges here. The graphics are excellent, the ads frequency are tolerable and become an acceptable routine. Having been in hotel management, this is a great primer for promotability. A few speed and music glitches here and there in upper levels but they work themselves out. Be patient. This game gets my highest rating ever! The music stays in your head all day! It's the greatest.",5,311,1.7.4
A. Q,"Ads issue. The game is nice and addictive. I like it. But like any other f2p games, you need you watch ads. Which is fine I understand. The problem is this: you watch the ads but you don't get the reward. It happened a lot of times, imagine waiting for a 20-30second ad to get a reward. And you don't get it.that is so frustrating. And when you contact the the customer support they tell you it's internet connection. Sure ..",2,304,1.8.2
Jenna Edgley,"Love the game, but the latest update has meant that I can't play the game in an enjoyable way anymore. I can watch one video and then it goes into a permanent loading cycle for all other videos until I restart the game, and then repeat. ***as of 9th of May 2021 this issue is STILL happening. It STILL always seems to tie in with when events are happening.***",1,280,1.9.9
A Google user,"I actually really enjoy this game. I h aven't encountered any issues add off yet. My only suggestion is earnings for all hotels should be combined into one 'account,' so when working on other hotels we can use that money. My first hotel is all updated but I still make money off of it and have no use for it. Anyways, keep up the great work!",5,279,0.3.1
JAM A,I like the game. I like the style and graphics. Game play is fun and challenging as you progress in unlocking the different hotels. I do hope more hotels will be added. I'm on the 2nd to last one. One request if it is at possible. When upgrading certain areas mainly bedrooms. An upgrade ALL button would be nice. It would work if you had enough money to completely upgrade everything in the room. Similar to how the manager informs you to build a room as you have enough money.,4,268,1.8.4
Kyle Doolady,"I maxed all hotels, haven't been on in a month and just checked to see if there was a new hotel.. nope, but Little Camelot got reset for the 3rd time on me now... I'm done.",2,262,1.9.8
Shambhu Nath Das,"The best game ever in my life keep it up!!! There are a lot of things to do. Great graphics. But I wish that there were more problems or events like different types of food, running out of food or water, theives, costumers who would pay more and different types of things to clean in the rooms. Overall, best idle game ever!",5,260,2.6.1
A Google user,"I actually enjoy the game quite a bit. Graphics are decent and it is good fun expanding and improving your hotel. I also love the little comedy bits (maid face down on sofa).There are loads of ads but they are optional, you are not forced to watch them if you choose not to. I usually hate games with too many ads, but I actually watched a lot of these because I wanted piles of extra cash to expand my hotel faster. I have again caught up to the developers, so am eagerly awaiting the next update.",5,258,1.3.1
A Google user,"It's pretty much impossible to make any progress without watching copious numbers of adverts - and over ¡ê10 for an advert-free version is daylight robbery. They're technically optional but if you want to achieve anything in a reasonable amount of time, you need that extra cash boost - especially because it's not a true idle game. You can have a full hotel, switch to another app, come back a few seconds later and your hotel is half empty. It doesn't properly simulate running in the background.",3,257,1.4.2
A Google user,"This is a wonderful game. Unlike all other idle games, the prices and income are fair and equal. Quite addictive and very satisfying to see the objects go from level one to 10. Also, almost no compulsory ads, and premium is not required to play in the slightest. This investor guy swings in every so often if you're running low on cash, offering an ad in exchange for a bunch of money. One thing for improvement; Please could we have a way to transfer funds from one hotel to another? Install btw!!!",5,256,1.2.2
A Google user,"The game was good in the beginning but then it started not giving me my bonus rewards after I watched the videos. Actually, when I pressed the video tab it played for a short second then went back to the game with no reward, that sucks cause my reward was $10,500 which would have helped my balance a lot!!! I'm afraid this game doesn't deserve any stars until this gets fixed. Also, I tried to post this without giving it a star and it wouldn't let me. Sad!",1,248,1.2.0
A Google user,"Don't be fooled about the lego-like graphics... this is really addictive!! Simple yet entertaining! A great way to get the basics of management. I just noticed that there is a bug with the housekeepers. Sometimes they get stuck (or hung up) and ends up not cleaning the room, then the option to clean all rooms for an ad pops up. But when you try to refresh the game, it all goes back to normal. Fix that, and I guess I could give a 5 star. __",4,243,1.7.1
Aayush Bennur,"I LOVE this game, the gameplay is super fun and allows me to relax when I am tense. Its not one of those easy games and requires strategey which I love. It hardly has any pop-up ads and there are only ads when you want a reward. The only reason why it is not 5-star is beacause it is slow in the beginning and if you want to grow fast you have to pay SO much money. Overall it is a great game and I recommened it to anybody who sees this post (if they like strategy games).",4,240,1.8.4
Anisha,"I enjoyed playing the game. Now that I have completed all levels ie all hotels. I don't know what to do except to uninstall. I did not mind add once in a while but there were too much. Also allow money earned from one hotel to be used in another. Plus there is no way we can customise, I feel we just have to see and click. Nothing else. Give us option to design our own hotel, in our own way, what facilities. That would have been much fun. Some activities to earn cash. There is no task I feel.",3,240,1.7.1
A Google user,"I love this simple game. Just enough to do that I can play while watching tv and it's not distracting. The event hotels are a nice wee addition. I don't mind the ads, it all helps the game along, but I have a major issue with 45 second + ads. Other ads can be as short as 15 seconds, but all I seem to get now are the long 45 seconds. There is no option to cut the ad short. This is reducing my rating and enjoyment of the game. 45 second ads are ridiculous!",3,238,1.7.1
Lloyd Alvarez,"It's a pretty decent game. It's real fun and addictive. It, however becomes so repetitive as you move on to another level. It's not much of an idle game because you have to check on it every 2hrs (unless of course you avail the VIP). It would be better if you have like a drone view option to view the overall activities in the hotel. Lastly, profit from the previous hotels should be used for the developing ones, otherwise it's useless.",2,231,1.8.3
Rebecca Parry,"I enjoy the game, but I have 2 suggestions for a near-future update, both based on the fact that once a hotel becomes 5 stars, it generates money but there's nothing else to spend it on (at least, nothing that I've found). I think it would be nice to be able to exchange game money for diamonds (as opposed to just real money), and transfer money from one hotel to another. I like the separation between hotel money instead of having 1 big money pot for all hotels, but I wish I could transfer money.",3,228,1.7.2
A Google user,I really liked this game at first but I agree with other critical reviews that ads disrupt gameplay. At first I didn't mind but once I got to the second hotel it was really disappointing that I couldn't use ANY profits or anything to make the new level easier..... it felt like there was no point in the first hotel existing. Even if I did spend the $10 I can tell the game would be completed in a few levels. Boring.,3,227,1.2.0
Peter Sportino,"I like some of the bug fixes. The game us still buggy. Ad crashes throw you out. By the way, the 1 minute 4 and 3 spot ads are really awful and way too long. It may be a deal breaker for me. Update: The bug fixes earned the full 5 stars. It really is fun now. I would love some new hotels to build. Fine job.",5,226,2.5.1
Pixie Bird,"Cute game. I loved the graphics and music, but most of the gameplay consisted of watching ads. The game was built in a way to forced you to watch ads. Unless you want to just sit there and watch your money deplete and your staff walk out on you, you watch the ads to boost your earnings. On top of that, there's no offline play. Overall, Hotel Empire Tycoon is a cute game to play when you have access to internet, time to kill, and don't mind watching ads for extended periods of time.",3,226,1.8.4
A Google user,"This is the best Codigames title yet! I've played pretty much all of them for several hours as I'm an idle game addict but I can't seem to put this one down at all. It has the most to do, the coolest progression, and the smoothest gameplay of any title in this series. I check this page every day to find out when the next hotel is released, and I can't wait to see what you guys have planned next!",5,216,1.2.0
A Google user,"Delightful and frustrating in equal measure. If you don't pay ¡ê10.49 to remove ads this game will drive you insane. The ads themselves are lowest of the low, awful misleading ads for games you just want to avoid. Some are over 40 seconds long! You're not given the option to skip ads which is pretty condescending. I paid to remove them for my own sanity. The game itself is good fun, well made, has some nice touches etc. Quicker methods of upgrading would be nice, and more affordable add-ons.",3,215,1.6.0
A Google user,"It's actually really fun, not like a lot of the money grab games you see now and days. It looks really pleasing and plays nicely. It's also got an ending objective. I oike jow your full on given an option to not see any ads, the only time I've run into them is if I wanted something from the game. The only real issue is it can get boring sometimes, and I would like if there were many more character models. Great game guys!",4,214,1.1.1
A Google user,"Game is good overall and it's different from what you guys made so far, BUT greed for money has to stop. Balance is just awful, at the beginning you can't make any money but only watching video ads to get cash from VIP. This sucks on so many levels...even though I managed to survive to next hotel after watching like 300+ ads.... this is just crazy guys....You need to do a better job on balance or you'll keep getting bad reviews like this one",2,214,1.1.1
A Google user,"I really enjoy this game and I love it a lot but there are quite a few issues I've run into which have caused me to give this game a 3 star rating instead of a 5 star. After you complete the tutorial portion of the game, the in-game character that is meant to help and advise you becomes absolutely useless. There's no help button or anything to help you in case you get stuck or have misunderstood something. When I opened up my second hotel it told me to keep working on my first to earn money for my second. However, you can't move funds between your hotels so I was lost for quite a long time trying to figure out how to do this when it's not possible. Many times the ads will take me to their download page and when I return to the game it restarts and I lose the reward. I've also been told that I've earned gems through watching ads but no gems were added to my balance. Sometimes ads won't even load or I'll click to watch an ad, no ads will come up and then my game gets stuck asking me if I want to watch an ad or not but it becomes unclickable. Also there is no clear time when my hotel will close while I'm not playing. There are locks that appear but they will say 2 hours and then as soon as I close my game it tells me my hotel closed, or sometimes it won't tell me until hours later. I've even gotten notifications that my hotel has closed while I'm actively playing. If these issues were fixed I would change my review to 5 stars because overall it is a really fun game to play, the graphics looks good and the areas are really beautiful.",3,213,1.3.0
Shelli Walters,"I am still waiting on a new hotel. When I first downloaded this game, it advertised 10 hotels. I've been waiting on the 8th hotel since last year some time. The event hotels don't last long enough. I pushed hard and actually hit the 50,000,000 mark once with very little sleep. If you have time to produce event hotels, then you have time to produce promised hotels.",1,209,1.9.91
NishaPlayz (Nisha),"This game is overall good. But there is one thing about the ads in the game that I think I should talk about. You see,the ads are not like regular ads, there like websites. It's really annoying knowing that a regular ad would talk 3-25 seconds long and theses ads are 40 seconds long. I think lots of people would like to get to the game from an ad alot quicker. I'm not so sure if it's just me or everyone else, but i'd really like it fixed. Thank you.",4,208,1.9.93

I love developers that don't force you to watch ads but give you the option if you choose for a reward.",5,207,1.2.0
brandon k,"Great game, must watch Ads if you want to build up quickly. The only down side is that the hotels you have 100% (not including gem upgrades) you should be able to transfer money from one hotel to the other. I understand the fact that it needs to get harder for each level, but each hotel has more and more expensive purchases. So using the other hotels would not really be too much easier.

The first bug is when you open the app, before you closed the app, and you had all rooms occupied, you rejoin, regardless of when, 2 rooms are open. Guests don't come sometimes. Your guests won't come. No cars, no nothing. Even the travel agency ad doesn't work. Daily balance bugged. 2 rooms open? Same daily balance. All rooms occupied? Same balance.

I need 20 stars total to move to the Imperator Palace; that's no problem, I've got all the money I need to upgrade everything. The problem comes with actually upgrading.

Eric Goins,"Normally I get tired of idle games because of their ""wash, rinse, repeat"" cycles. I never got what was so appealing about those. This one, however, is a bit different. The pace is still the same: buy and upgrade to make money. That's where they continued where most don't. Energy, customer attraction, service speed, , staff expenses...these are all minor details that, when added to a simple idle game, really change how you play.

There should be some element in game which makes this go away. Either transferring the cash to other hotel managements or adding some features for continuous cash flow. Also adding google play achievements is a good thing. And in-game purchases are very costly, furthermore after any purchase, the game will end in a week or two.",4,185,1.2.0

Possibly Dell Honne,"Great fun, I dislike idle games but this one caught me off guard by how invested I got in so little time. Yes, the best way to build is through Ads.

And sometimes when you leave the game after you watched a video it will reset some to all the money you got from watching the ad. Other then these small problems it's a great game and would recommend to anyone who is feeling the need to do something.",5,162,1.8.3
Jessica Wooten,"I loved it at first. Then I paid $10 to remove all the ads and enjoyed it more. I made it to the 7th level. All the hotel guests go to the same place regardless if it's open or not on every level. When you switch to a different hotel or log out entirely, you instantly lose guests. In my experience up to 10 guests at a time would instantly be removed from the hotel depending on your level. Therefore, you make waaaayyyyy LESS money to none after you log out. Waste of time and effort.",1,161,1.8.1
A Google user,"Great game. Love the management aspect. And that this game is not a clicker. It's really hard to find games like this one on mobile. I personally like that it's vertical so I don't have to turn my phone. Though, a lot of bugs when it comes with advertisements. I'm experiencing a lot of freezes whenever I watch a video for some cash or 2x profit which results to not getting the bonus at all. Hope you guys fix it!",4,160,1.2.1
Eleanor Griffiths,"NEED NEW CONTENT!! Updating now to just 1 star as still waiting on a new hotel to be introduced. That's over 2 years we have been waiting! I paid good money to not see ads and to update the managers in yet Codigames seems to want to just bring out more and more new games, (which are too fussy and iver complicated) instead of respecting the players of the ones they already have! Theme Park and Prison NEED NEW CONTENT!",1,160,1.9.97
A Google user,Pretty cool... Starts off a little slow and you've got to be pretty strategic. The option to watch ads for more money is great and the ads I've seen are 15sec or shorter. It's a great game to wake up to because you earn money while you sleep too. I just purchased my second hotel so we'll see. The only suggestion I have is to be able to choose different styles and look in your hotel... Color options would be cool.,5,159,1.2.0
Vania Buntaran,"Edit: I've reached Little Camelot now and thank you for reading my review before (I asked for different upgrade in rooms). It's really refreshing and now I couldn't stop playing it even more. The ads doesn't bothered me because in fact I used the double time ads everytime. If I could give suggestion, it would be great to have a Chinese Imperial style Hotel (like those in colossal drama). I think that'd be really cool! ^^",5,158,1.9.91
Florence Firth,"This game is amazing! It's so fun and addictive. I play this for hours and hours every day! It's quite hard and slow at first, but once lots of money starts coming in it becomes easier and more laid back. I also love how there are a variety of different hotels that you can unlock later on in the game. I definitely recommend this game. If you are considering installing it... then what on earth are you waiting for?!",5,158,1.9.93
A Google user,"Awesome game! Rarely do I play a mobile game for more than a day or 2. But this one was so well done I 5 stared all of the hotels. My only ""complaint"" is that once you get 5 stars on a hotel, there is never a reason to revisit it, which also means once you 5 star the last one, you're done. I would love to see something to bring you back to the first ones. Or maybe once you finish the last one, you can restart in a mastery mode. Again, awesome game, I'll be checking out some of their other ones",5,158,1.3.1
A Google user,"I really love the game itself from the cute effects to the details of the game. Overall its really good and i really love it. But, as for this game is for killing time, i would love to have this game offlined and can be accessed by anyone anytime anywhere without any internet connections. Maybe someday in the future you'll have an offline game tycoon for everybody.__",4,158,1.3.1
A Google user,"This game is fun for the first hour and then it's just the same boring stuff. If you want to progress at all, you have to watch ads upon ads. If you pay to remove the ads, the game gets too easy and you just wait for the dancing money guy to give you all the money you need. By the 3rd hotel, I only come back for a minute to collect the offline money and spam the upgrade button a few times. There doesnt seem to be much strategy, just watch ads, upgrade stuff and come back later.",2,157,1.3.0
Hyacinth Fernando,"Loved the game! I have a request, please make the guest utilize the other facilities, and make them use their room balconies, example from the blue crystal resort's suit rooms make the guests use their private swimming pool, slides, and let them relax, sun bathe on their decks, also make them do activities like swim on the ocean, sun bathe while the beach bar is close, night party at the beach bar, you know dancing, and making some trouble. I would love to see guests interacting with each other.",4,154,1.9.93
KP,"Was fun in the beginning, but now it's gotten old. My event hotel keeps getting deleted for no reason causing me to start over every time. Also, the old hotels are pointless and there's no reason to go back to them after you've finished them. 2 stars because its a good idea, and fun at first.. but they need to fix some bugs and think of some new ways to keep people interested longer. I'll edit this if that ever happens.",2,152,1.8.1
Midhun,"Ads are cheating most of the time. Other than that, nice game. Placement of ad feature is perfect though as if you have to watch some ad now and then to earn some extra money, like getting a loan. Its just it doesnt work most of the time when needed. Sometimes, the ad button takes years to load, sometimes if we click it, the ad wont play, sometimes even if we watch the whole ad only to get some money for the game, we dont get the promised money. It happens mostly when the money is big",3,149,1.7.2
A Google user,"It's an okay game while you're bored but there are way too many ads and most of the time the ads DONT work. You click the button to watch it and it just goes back to the game without loading any video. You have to exit out of the game a few times to even get one to work again. Not worth it, find a different hotel game that doesnt require ads every 2 seconds to get any kind of revenue to expand your hotels.",2,148,1.2.0
chulin pan,"The game is fun and i quite enjoy playing it but there are several bugs that drive me crazy!! One of the bug is alright which is I can't get the money sometimes after i watch the ads. but the other one, the most terrible one, is that last night i go to bed for like 8 hours but when i wake up and open the game, it didn't increase my money at all!!! i don't want to play this game anymore until these bugs are fixed.",2,147,1.7.2
Coriann Howard,"Only game I have ever actually finished fully. I love the different locations. It is a bit repetitive, but it seems to keep you entertained and watching your guests roam and explore and utilize the services is great! Also, paying to get rid of ads is worth it. $10 is a steep, but it transfers to every hotel and you get $ from the VIP guest instantly, which is one of the main ways to get cash in game. It would also be grand if they added a hotel/game reset button. I'd love to play again.",5,146,1.9.95
A Google user,"So after playing for almost a week and I confidently say you are not going to get anywhere unless you watch ads literally every 2 minutes. I understand that it's a free game but the amount of money it takes to upgrade and get more hotels is pretty high and it will take you A WHILE to unlock. I would watch an ad for 30 seconds, get around 2,000 upgrade something and then wait for the money man to come and give me another ad so I could upgrade. Graphics are cute but money is too slow without ads.",2,145,1.2.0
Roberto Silva,"Fun game, have to watch adds but not a problem you don't have to pay to get ahead, I finish all the hotels at 100% but that's it there's no more hotels. They should add more hotels, they should also have the people do different things at different times. They should not all go to the restaurant some should go to the pool, arcade, bar, etc maybe also add in room service. We should be able to make the schedule we want out shops to be open they close to soon or open to late.",4,142,1.7.2
A Google user,"I love this game, it's very addicting. I just got to my second hotel and its so much fun. I love that you can watch ads to double your money or just earn more altogether! Watch a 30 second add for 8,000 more dollars? Sold. I love that even after you've finished your hotel and moved on to thee next one you can go back to the original one and continue to upgrade it until it is five star, and continue to earn money from it as well. 10/10 will reccomend!",5,142,1.2.0
Toni Warning,"Great game but needs updates - similar to everyone else, I have to say: ALLOW MONEY TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM HOTEL TO HOTEL. If I'm the one building it, the money should go with me! Especially if I'm still earning on hotels that are no longer able to be upgraded. The money is still sitting there, accruing, and I can't use it! Ends up being disappointing in the end.",3,140,1.7.1
A Google user,"I really enjoyed playing this game, but am sad that there are no more hotels after 30 stars. I recently just paid extra money to have 10 hours of open hotel idle time, and unlimited double profits, but I only got to use it for the last hotel. If I'd have known it was the last hotel, I wouldn't have spent an extra $15 on this game. I'm really bummed because I would've loved to keep playing, but there are no more levels after 6 hotels? __",3,140,1.7.1
Ashley Clark,"Honestly this game is pretty neat. The art is very cute, simple and yet really nice to look at! I love that the hotels really change from one to the next. The ads are well placed and entirely optional. Events feel impossible unless you're willing to spend money, and honestly I might consider it if there was more to do. Once you finish a hotel, it's pretty useless, which kinda sucks. And I'm pretty sure there's a set number of hotels so eventually, you'll beat the game I assume. Great game tho!",4,138,1.7.2
Rose TS,It's really good! The ads are optional. And it's fun when you understand the trick or what to do first. I've been playing since feb/mar2020. Haven't bored once. I'm glad they keep it updated and adding more hotels to maintain (I was half afraid the game would be 'that's all' after I'm done with 3 hotels that's available when I first played it). Good job!,5,138,1.8.4
KK Wong,"The game is alright if you buy the ad free in-app purchase, but if you ask for that amount of money, you should be offering a better gameplay 1)guest ai, who would spend all day "" visiting"" all the facilities in the hotel but don't get to use any of then because of ""bad timing"" 2)restaurant, queue limit at 6 but not proportional to the number of chefs? 3)after the first couple of hotel, it gets old as the hotel items are very repetitive.4)guests check out at 11:30pm?",2,138,1.8.4
A Google user,"There's not enough to do within a hotel, ever. I get that creating a hotel and different quests takes time, but the game should have never released if you were going to force us to wait WEEKS to even be able to play again IF a new hotel is released. I can't believe I wasted money on the ad free, I want a refund immediate",2,138,1.2.2
A Google user,"The game was fun but there's only four hotels and literally nothing to do when you have those completed. Rated 1star for the misleading description: ""hire drivers, porters... provide laundry service or sightseeing tours... build triple or even King rooms"" None of that is possible. Either add all the above in to the game, or remove it from your description",1,136,1.2.2
Gabriel Mapalo,"The game so far is very good, I enjoy it a lot, but there is a bug at The Stanley Resort where whenever I leave with no rooms available, I come back to the couples rooms empty, I don't know if I just timed it with them checking out but it always happens. It's doesn't affect the gameplay much, but the progress slows down a bit because I can't earn using those couples rooms.",5,135,1.9.91
B B,"It's an amazing game! Addicting and fun. My only concern is that you make a lot of money from another hotel that you've unlocked, but you can't transfer any of that cash you've made into the current hotel your working on. I hope more levels come soon too because I'm nearly finished all the hotels. Other than that, the game is very fun and would recommend it. A couple glitches here and there where house keeping staff go into a room, clean it, then stay in one spot and never leave that spot",4,135,1.8.4
Brian Carr,"Great game. Lots of enjoyment. Upgrade all kinds of things. As fantastic as this game is, it is plagued with ads that fail to load or connect you back to the game for your reward. The amount of times you have to reset the game as a result and losing out on your reward is appalling. ... Update. Became tired of trying to play the game now starting on the 4th Hotel. Came back after a couple of weeks. The first ad I go to watch for 2x pay for 10 minutes stalled the game forcing a reset. Uninstalling",1,132,1.8.2
A Google user,Fun game but the ads don't load half the time. Just a blank screen you can't even x out of so you're staring at a blank screen for half a minute and you don't even get any rewards Sometimes it also doesn't even register that I wasn't playing in the game so when I come back to the game it's like I wasn't even away and have had no money made,1,132,1.1.1
Emily Dethlefsen,"So I'm addicted to idle games. They're perfect for a quick in and out game. This one is by far the best. I usually get bored, or the game stop progressing in an interesting way. I'm on the last hotel and had to say something before I finished it and forgot about it. Each stage is different! You don't just restart the same thing with a new added goal to reach, this one has different hotels with cool themes and fun items to build. Thank you creators, I had a blast with your game!<3",5,131,1.9.93
Gelo Gelo,"It is just impossible to surpass the beginning of each hotel without watching ads. Meaning, you will have to watch ads until you get to upgrade items to lessen your debt. Employees wages are too high that's why instead of a positive revenue, you will have negative revenue and even debt. I am playing Idle Inn Tycoon instead. That's much better App of yours.",1,131,1.9.91
A Google user,"This game is awesome! Once i started playing the cash flow in the game was great! The great thing is, i have not bought ( with real money ) any if the perks, because all you have to do is watch an ad to get a smaller version of them. The only thing i dont like is that sometimes when you want to waych an ad to get a perk, it doesnt work. If you like tycoons, this is the game for you.",5,131,1.2.1
A Google user,"I would rate this game much higher if it wasnt so glitchy! I watch the adds in order to get the VIP money, and it never fails that when a good prize is offered, the ad freezes or I get a ""Video playback can not be played at this time"" error message and I miss out on getting the reward. The ad that it ALWAYS freezes on is an Amazon grocery delivery advertisement. Please fix this and I will happily give a higher rating! My app is up to date, btw.",1,130,1.3.0
A Google user,"This is a really nice addicting game. 5 minutes into the game and I bought the no ads item and I haven't regretted it. The drawbacks of this game are: 1)you can't play multiple hotels simultaneously as the next unlocks when the current is finished. 2)Not challenging at all, victory is certain, you just try to get there faster. 3)Purchasing something for a specific event seems pointless. The reward is to reduce the time to certain victory, thus reduce your gameplay time. 4)No replay value",4,128,1.7.1
Nathan Bissett,"Super addictive, fun game. With a few pretty big drawbacks. The amount of adds you need to watch to get anywhere is absurd, the events are fun but impossible to get 3 stars unless you pay $15 every week to get the bonus that should be permenant if bought once. The additional costs for the VIP guy and the guy to keep to place open for 10 extra hours are also a bit much. In the events, if you've bought the permanent VIP, too bad. There's a lot of little things that could improve the game majorly.",3,128,1.8.3
Nikko Ramos,"Nice graphics, easy to play, and entertaining. I bought the ad free and it's worth it! But after a few weeks of playing it, i found a hug in their event hotel.

A Google user,"This is a super good game. Very creative and colorful amd perfect. Really recommend it to all of you. However the only problem was the design for rooms are so messy and cause confusion. Other stuffs like the bar, restaurant, spa or pool are very beautiful but I think the room's decoration has to be improved by reducing some useless stuffs. And you can only see the confusion after you have upgraded every thing in the room (at first it was beautiful and enough).",4,127,1.2.0

There are plenty of mobile ""management"" games that aren't much more than clicker games, but this one actually has some management aspects to it, which make it a more involved experience.

Issue I have is that all the sudden, when I click on a video ad via the ""Invester Offer"", the video doesn't load and it glitches, and I lose the money for the offer. You guys need to address that. I never thought I wouldn't mind clicking on video ads. But if I'm not going to get the credit, then what's the point?

Once you get 5 stars on your last hotel theres literally nothing else to the game.

Yes it takes a while to do it and that is why you have an option to spend money. As for the ads, In order to get double profits, you have to return to your hotel while the multiplier is still on. It also works for every hotel, not just one it brings you to. 4 stars because there are no more hotels as of right now.",4,118,1.4.2
kaiku,"Brilliant game, I love the fact that ads are optional to watch and aren't shoved in your face every two seconds. Clearly well thought out by the devs. I love that the perks aren't a monthly subscription, but are a one time payment. I feel as though many game developers are very money hungry and only use subscriptions, so I thank you devs for being very considerate of your player base.

Arun Dongaonkar,"This would have been five stars if not for a few things that started to annoy me. For starters, the guests walk around like a flock of sheep, going only in a one way system around the hotel. So you end up losing money as attractions are closed by the time they get to them. Also, on imperator, every time I click off it, it kicks 5 guests out the hotel, so i always have 5 rooms empty. The items are ridiculously expensive. A few tweaks and this game could be great.",3,116,1.7.3

7,"This game is fun, but very slow. It'd be nice for the profits to be slightly increased. It can get boring quickly waiting for income to upgrade stuff. I'd be interested in a PC version of you sold one on steam. Keep it simple, fun but with more content (varied locations, forest, desert, snow, etc. ).",4,105,2.3.3
A Google user,"The game would be fun. I have been playing now for a couple of weeks. In that time u have sent about 10 emails because the ads for the dancing guy don't work!! They claim to sent the info to someone to get it fixed, but then things get worse!!! Now the app freezes when I try to view the ads from the dancing guy. This game has gone from good to the worst app I have ever played a game on!!!! Do Not download unless you want to be frustrated all the time!!!",1,103,1.2.0
A Google user,"The gameplay and the graphics are cool but it takes just too much time to get enough money to make new rooms and develop the hotel. You can easily get money from watching video ads, sadly you will do that every 8 seconds so the game become repetitive and too slow to get somewhere. I was watching a 14 seconds and every 10 seconds of gameplay to get some money and even that way I couldn't build much :(",2,102,1.2.0
A Google user,"Overall it's a cute idle tycoon game. I would give it more stars but I have a few issues with it. First is the ads, there's so many that it wants you to watch. They're not absolutely required but make a big difference in how fast you can proceed. Second problem is after watching the ads, sometimes it does not give you the rewards you were watching the ad for. That's very frustrating!!",3,101,1.4.2
Donessia Harris,"I updated my review a few days ago but I figured out that bug (advertising campaign) I thought since I brought that manger I didn't need it. I've been playing recently and my game is glitching. I'll come back to a hotel and all my staff are just walking in (no matter the time or shift). My guest go to use services then pack up and leave, sometimes w/o checking out (losing money)!! Fix please!!",4,101,1.8.4
A Google user,"Good game! Very good. Graphics are good and I like the music choices. I don't mind ads to get __ and I like you have to get stars to progress! Also,ignore all the people who saying bad stuff about this out of spite(insulting graphics etc) but don't ignore people who report bug fixes. No bugs makes a person happier. One 5 __ review =1 bug fixed",5,100,2.0
A Google user,"*updated* enjoyable game, but last few days finding that if I come back into the game after not playing it for a few hours, and watch a clip to double my profits, it is not doubling the profits, so i am missing out on the extra dollars. Makes it frustrating when expecting it to give it to you. Be great to have this fixed asap or maybe time to play another game.",1,100,1.2.0
A Google user,This is a great game for killing time! I like how you don't have to constantly monitor every little aspect. The design is cute and it is rewarding to level up the items in your hotel. I downloaded a few other games from this developer. While they are very good(especially the other idle games) this one is my favorite. I just unlocked the last available hotel and am really hoping more content will be released!,5,97,1.2.0
A Google user,"I've been playing this game for a few days, and it's really addictive but I do some suggestions. Firstly, the amount of ads is ridiculous, 80% of my time is spent watching them, so gameplay is limited. The upgrade to remove ads is very expensive, you may find that more people purchase this at a lower cost. I'm struggling to see how I will reach the 5th star on my 1st hotel, and therefore unlock the 3rd hotel. My 1st hotel is making money but I can't use it! I should be able to use it on another.",3,97,1.7.1
Nathan Provinson,"I love the concept of the game. But with gems you can't buy anything but unnecesarry room or kitchen boosters. After you proceed to the next hotel you do not get x2 income or so (is too long of a grind). The main reason for 2 stars are the Advertisments. It is simply taking too many ads to complete one room and manage expenses plus, a lot of times when I watch the ad thru, I do not get that in game currency. Otherwise I really like the idea behind this game and it's style.",2,96,1.8.2
A Google user,"Really cute and entertaining idle game! I love that you get to choose when to watch ads, it makes me feel like I'm actually getting something from them instead of just filling the dev's pocket. This is the only mobile game where it doesn't feel monotonous, It's balanced well where when you buy upgrades you actually feel like you are improving. I play it every night before bed to relax and it gets the job done. Tldr; Non-intrusive ads and good gameplay.",5,96,1.3.1
A Google user,The game is incredibly slow. Boosting profits by 2x only gives you 10 minutes per ad. Max 2 hours. I have to watch 12 ads to get Max?? There's a guy dance in your lobby asking you to watch an ad for money you can get in 30 minutes also. Along with five other watch ad and get money/boost. Almost 50% of the screen is asking you to watch ads or pay for no ads.,1,96,1.4.2
A Google user,"I've had to watch a lot of videos to stay in the black. Otherwise I found it enjoyable in the beginning. However, once I decided to pay to disable ads (way too much I might add) it became repetitive and boring. The final two hotels showed lazy development, reusing car sounds when the flying carpet shows up, buggy people stuck in walls, etc. When you get 5 stars on the last hotel, nothing happens. You're at the end of the game with nothing to do except delete it. Disappointing purchase.",3,94,1.3.1
A Google user,"Great idle game, can't really find fault, rating 4 stars due to the lack of levels, but other than that it's your typical idle game. I do wish your money carried over per hotel, but I understand why it doesn't. There is no major pay to win either. You can pay to remove adds but that's about it. The closing of the hotel after 2 hours is an intresting feature that I quite enjoyed! You can pay to keep it open for 10 hours. But I never felt the need. Which is great!",4,94,1.2.1
Fariz Setyadi,"I LOVE the game! The first 2 hotels was fun but the 3th one was a bit difficult and a bit more expensive, making it a little bit harder to complete, and mostly, the people staying at the hotels usually appear at the facilities but sometimes they were still closed, I think you need some kind of code that could trigger the customers only when its the right time.",4,93,2.3.3
Sahil Chhetri,"It's a really entertaining and engaging game.I had played this game 3 hours straight on the first day itself and watched over 20 ads... Though I like it very much, I didn't liked the manner in which we are asked to pay for something that it's quite obviously a need for us.. moreover the payment gateway always shows errors that's why I cannot buy something with real currency even if I want to . please fix this and I won't hesitate even a bit giving it. 5 stars :P",4,93,1.9.93
Justin B Meranda,"This game is a good distraction for slow moments. I can see how the ads are annoying but the remove ads feature is helpful for low price. The only disadvantage is there is an end to this game. After the last hotel, that is it no more hotels available. There is nothing left to do, no reset to the beginning hotel or any more challenges.",4,92,1.9.8
A Google user,"The game is a lot of fun, and I find myself opening it quite often to check on my hotel. However, the prices on the in-app purchases are way too high for the game that it is. Most people wouldn't pay more than $0.99-$1.99 for an entire game on google play, nobody wants to pay $10.99 JUST to turn off ads, that's way too high. The other in-app purchases are just as bad",3,92,1.4.0
A Google user,"THIS GAME IS Amazing! In most tycoon games, you just keep on upgrading the same thing over and over again and the 'renovating' and basically doing the same thing over and over. This game is much more sensible since there are many ways to spend your cash. Each new hotel has a unique style, with new upgrades and services. I really think that the images below don't quite capture the best parts of the game. Ads are not required you can watch them for bonuses but otherwise they don't appear.",5,92,1.5.0
J Hernandez,"Super fun for anyone! Wish I could use profits from one hotel somewhere else. I get that it shouldn't be used for the next build, but I have no reason to go back into an old hotel when it gets 5 stars. What about a bank option where I can earn enough in all my locations for a gem or take out a loan to purchase hotels and use profits to pay it off... Ya know, kinda like in real life? Otherwise, love the events and there are enough hotels to keep going, for now...",4,92,1.8.3
Morgann Hansen,This is a great spin on traditional idle games. You can largely play this game without paying anything though I suggest buying the manager that lets you accumulate cash for 10 hours. My only concerns are the events and needing new hotels. I hope you guys come out with an update adding more hotels soon! The events are damn near impossible to complete without paying the $10 EACH time for the suites. It's kind of BS. The rest of the game it great.,4,92,1.8.4
A Google user,"I absolutely love this game, the progress is well paced, and strategy does play a small part in playing it, knowing how and when to invest your money in upgrades and staff and extras. It does require alot of ad watching if you wish to progress at a reasonable pace. Normally that would bother me, but for this game, it benefits you to leave it open (more customers show up) so I just leave the game open and click in and out of the ads while I do other things, like homework and such. I recommend :)",5,91,1.3.1
A Google user,It was a fun game at first until after you have completed the first hotel and come to find you cant use any of your money from that hotel towards the next. Whats the point with all that money building up with nothing to spend it on when everything is upgraded to the top tier? Pointless. I advise to def not use any of your real money on this game. Im glad i didnt i would have been furious if i had.,2,91,1.5.0
Jamarce Banks,"The game is perfect aside from the guest AI, which is terrible. Guests completely ignore when services are available and check at random times. There should be a way to improve this feature at the front desk. Making sure guests know when services are available is important when minimizing losses and maximizing profits.",4,90,1.9.93
Kath G,"This is the most best game I have ever gotten!______It never forces you to watch ads, you can choose to if you want double profits or something like that. I also love that the game goes on for an entire hour even after you close it out, so when you get back you have more money than when you left! One question though, even if I have more than 6 tables then why does it only let in 3 or 4 people at a time? Is it because I need to hire more chefs__? Please let me know. Thank you ________",5,90,1.8.4
Desiree H,"Game's pacing is good, I don't find myself wishing I was progressing any faster or slower. Had some issues getting my hotels to 5 stars in order to move on to the 3rd hotel, so I contacted the devs and the issue was resolved! I appreciate their quick response, I just wish I'd been more proactive with contacting them. ____",5,90,1.7.1
Miranda Richardson,"After downloading and getting to the second hotel, the ""investor"" for ads doesn't show up anymore and neither does the button to watch an ad for 2x earning. So the game is now basically just sitting and waiting for the tiny profit to add up very, very slowly. Makes it less playable and if the ad guy doesn't come back I will be deleting as he was the only thing that keeps the game moving.",3,89,2.8
A Google user,"Although the game is lengthy in terms of racking up enough funds to upgrade rooms fully and buy new parts for your hotel, after a few days and also a lot of ads from the investor to help speed up the process I finished the first hotel and moved on to the next. Overall, from what I have experienced, the game is very fun and rewarding when you begin to take off a bit more. It's quite polished and there are no ads other than when getting optional benefits. Can recommend :)",4,88,1.2.0
Isabel C,"Nice game but you have a bug in your event hotel. The cleaner sometimes gets stuck in the room and doesn't finish cleaning. Also having a buy all option would make the game more fun. There aren't much updates or variation between the hotels, once you finish the hotel there isn't much point in going back to them. Maybe daily quests for each hotel? The event hotel is way too difficult if you don't play continuously for the whole period or buy the package.",3,88,1.8.4
Gerard Parham,"Great game, love playing it every chance I get. The issues I have is at points I can't watch videos to increase 2x profit time. When the guy/gal comes to invest I can't watch their videos to receive money either. When I start the game it let's the videos play, but during the game I have to close the app and restart all the time. That's the only way I can watch the videos",2,88,1.7.3
Marshall Earnshaw,"It's a bit of fun, very similar to prison empire. The rewards for watching ads is very low and sometimes they won't load properly so are unavailable. In app purchase prices are way too high for what you get. I don't understand, if you're the hotel empire tycoon, why cant you use the profits from the hotels you are running really well to upgrade the next hotel?",2,87,1.8.4
Adam Hunter,"Addictive game, shame so many ads. ¡ê10 a bit steep to get rid of them, ¡ê5 would be better. About the game though, if you are the ""manager"" of the hotels, shouldn't you be able to take money from other hotels that are fully equipped making money to help in new hotel ""ventures""?? Would be a nice addition.",4,87,1.7.2
Mizohican Kima,"I am playing this game again after a long time and I now see new content including events feature. Well done. However, the ads multiplier is STILL NOT WORKING! I have purchased the ""No more ads"" feature for _ 920, and what is the point in skipping the ad when the double reward do not come! This is pure cheating. This issue had been raised by many since the beginning, and even after updating this game you still haven't fixed this bug. Until you fix this issue, I am not going to play this game.",1,86,1.7.1
A Google user,"I would LOVE to give this game a 5 star. It was fun, cute, detail-oriented, everything you want from a tycoon game. But one BIG issue was when I log out from the game, the guests from the double rooms suddenly missing from my hotel. I tried to logout just for a few seconds and login afterwards and they're gone. Please fix this and i will give 5 stars back.",3,86,1.3.1
Rifky Naufaliandra,"Overall its a good game with a great gameplay. perhaps it could be improved by making the customer become more natural. make them interact each other, they look like a robot in a loop pattern. 3 rooms having a shower together at the same time, sleep in a same bed but having a different table at restaurant, make them more natural like a real social creature. I think thats all, thank you.",4,85,1.7.1
A Google user,"I've been playing this game for weeks now, it's quite fun and addicting but I'm giving it three stars because of the extremely expensive and absurd microtransactions. These microtransactions are called ""Managers"", they cost $14.99 each and there are three of them, one of them let's you make hotel cash offline for 10 hours, instead of 2 hours. The other manager doubles money and the third removed ads. Buying the third one makes the second one useless and it isn't really worthwhile",3,85,1.6.0
A Google user,"I really enjoy this game, it is one of the better idle games! My only complaint is the Events only last 3 days and it is impossible to win without having to spend real money! I am an avid played and spent so long on the event, watched all the ads, got the multiplier again and again but still not even close to earning a star. It would be good if the events were longer to give people who don't pay for games a fair chance.",4,84,1.5.0
A Google user,There's no point even playing after the first hotel. Progress is excruciatingly slow. So slow you're practically forced to watch ads to get anywhere at all and even that isn't enough. It's clear this is just a garbage money grab since a permanent x2 is $11 and to earn a x2 without paying you have to watch an ad for TEN MINUTES of time. That's all you get. Garbage game from a garbage company.,1,84,1.2.0
A Google user,How did I get sucked into another one of these games lol. I've already done the Theme Park one and SuperMarket one. Must be doing something right lol. I love these games because you actually get to SEE the progress you make so its satisfying. I really love this one! Thank you for fixing the money dancing guy! 5 Star Game all around! Keep up the good work! :),5,84,1.2.2
Billy Kaspersen,"The game is very addictive and enjoyable. I did the payment for no adds and worked great. However when I paid in the recent ""Event"" to be able to build 3x presidential suites, my money was taken but without the benefit given. Disappointed.

Hannah Carter,"It's a pretty fun game so far, but there is either a really annoying bug in it or I'm doing something wrong here...for some reason, even though I have 4 tables, apparently only 2 tables can be occupied at a time. The other people will stand in line as if there aren't any empty tables, and then get angry and leave pretty much right at the time a person finishes eating. It's like they are practicing social distancing or something...it's really wierd.",3,83,1.7.4
Bryan Hemingway,"I definitely enjoy this game. At first it seemed like a standard idle builder. The lower levels are easy but instructive. Then you hit the first timed event and you realize that there is a lot more strategy involved. I was blown out of the water on my first event, the second I reached the one star goal, and the third a two star goal. The optional ad model is nice although after playing awhile I bought the ad-free experience ( both worth supporting the dev and enhancing overall enjoyment ).",4,82,1.8.1
A Google user,"I've been playing this game for a week and so far It's not so bad. It kind of sucks that the only way to get the perks are to watch ads or pay. My recent encounter that's lasted the whole day so far is that I don't even have the option to watch ads anymore. The dancing guy, the taxi icon and fast forwarding to the next day are still options, but when I click watch video, it doesn't do anything. Please fix!!!",3,82,1.6.0
Sasha Scarah,"Update: They fixed the issue of it not giving the funds so as promised five stars, it's a really fun game, I just opened my third hotel in it. Hoping they add more hotels __ I actually really like this game but it has one huge issue. When I come back to the game after not playing it a while it'll say I've earnt X amount but when I click continue or watch the and to double the amount it doesn't give me the money I've earned while away.

A Google user,"It's a great game. I've been playing for less than a week and I'm 90% done the third location. The build is neither rushed or too slow. I don't feel it's necessary to always watch the ads to get further, it's possible without doing so. The only downfall I wish there's more locations (future updates?), or hopefully more to do in each location in future updates. All in all, this is what I look for in an idle game. You don't have to constantly reset to get ahead, make more money, etc. THANK GOD",4,81,1.1.1
A Google user,Like this game... But... It has improved a lot in the months I've been playing it. I've done the first three hotels to five star and the Xmas one is almost finished. I like the idea of events in this but this current one is ridiculous. I've got just over 4million of the 10million required for one star and that's just in a day and a half so how you expect us to get to 100million in that time is beyond me. The only way we can make that much is to buy the upgrade and that's a big no.,3,81,1.4.0
Lily Smith,"I absolutely love this game. Great graphics. Great work guys! But I do want to say that I wish you could use money from another hotel to upgrade another one. For instance when you complete a hotel the money is useless and completed hotels earn more money, but uncompleted ones are incredibly hard when you only get 2000 dollars after a paycheck 9000. Please look into it. Thank you",4,80,1.7.1
A Google user,This was a pretty nice game. A game to play when there's nothing else to do. But the sheer amount of ads you NEED to watch to actually progress is annoying and didn't need to be included what so ever. If you don't watch ads you 1. Don't get money to upgrade certain things that you actually need and 2. If you don't have enough money your staff quit.,2,80,1.5.0
Aaron Wong Wen Jin,They provide x2 profit after you watch a 15-35seconds ads but most of the time after watching the ads you won't get the profit especially when the profit is high amounts.

The time spent on watching the ads is longer than playing the game,1,80,1.8.2

My only complaint is that the prices are exceptionally high for the ""vip"" status during events or to get rid of ads (which I did because I play the game so much and appreciate it!). Would love it if you could unlock the vip ($10.99 - OUCH) for events ONE time and keep that status for ALL events. It's ridiculous to spend that much money once, let alone for every event...",3,80,1.7.1
Alicia Miller,"Love this game, wish there was more hotels. I've already completed all the hotels. So definitely needs more hotels so people can keep playing.

Matthew Heller,"This game is a notch above other idle games! Unlike other idle games where you just mash a button and upgrade components, this actually requires some patience and micromanaging.

Overall, it's a great game. Loving it so far!",5,79,1.7.1

A,"I dig the plot, the graphics, and the goals. my issues are with how much actual money you have to spend to have a decent playing experience. I'm not even saying it would be an exceptional playing experience, just one worth playing. The manager cost $10, the dog to remove ads cost $5. if you watch ads, you get cash/customers, no problem. an option to use diamonds to obtain a manager should be on the table, however he can't cost more than 300 diamonds, when you're only rewarded 5 at a time.",2,77,1.8.4

Jesse and Ebonie,"I appreciate the update that allows you to see the upgrade percentage of a room/facility from the menu. It was inconvenient to search each section to check.

Update: a hotel was posted that didn't need all the stars __ thank you Devs. If I may suggest something else: it would be awesome to have a group/mass upgrade ability. It's a lot of time and attention to upgrade over 40 rooms, each with 15+ upgradeable items.",4,77,1.8
Misty Wild,Lots of bugs on the beach... Every time I exit and come back to the game I have 2+ available rooms (doesn't matter if it is 5 minutes or 2 hours) even though I literally WATCHED the guests check in.

Three days later I beat the second... Then the game started constantly kicking me out and back to the loading page. Can't watch an ad (which is the biggest part of earning money) to double profits or make money from the VIP customer. Takes too long now to keep my attention. So sad.",1,76,1.4.0
Rich Vance,"This is an interesting game, but it has one very major flaw. If you ever close the game, the next time that you open it, your double occupancy rooms are all vacant!

Those rooms then sit empty, not earning anything, until after check-out time. You really need to fix that.",2,76,1.7.2
Unique Garland,"I love this game. I was playing it on my tablet and it kept freezing, so I started playing it on my phone and it's fine. My only problem is that all my hotels are 5 stars, and there's nothing left for me to do until the codi hotels pop up. I also don't like that it's $10.99 each time to get presidential suites. It doesn't roll over to the next codi hotel, and it should. Things cost way too many diamonds. Other than that it's fine. It needs more hotels.",4,75,1.9.95
Alina Avina,"I like it... it's fun, but I wish when you finish with one hotel & advance to the other hotels, the extra money should at least go to the next hotels. Plus I wish that the rooms, upgrades, & other resorts wasn't so dang ridiculously expensive!!!

I'll admit I enjoyed it, although sometimes it can be frustrating, however, I think it could be better. Soo, I will have to give it 3 stars.",3,74,1.8.4
Chenica Lee,"I don't often write reviews on games, but in this case I felt it was necessary. This game is only fun if you enjoy watching ads. I've watched probably 3 times more ads on this game, all in an attempt to get ahead. The game won't hold your attention for more than 2-3 weeks. The constant ads and the cost of in-game items is ridiculous. The regular event is impossible to advance in without spending money. But beware! The advantage is only good for 4 days and doesn't return for the next one. No wins",2,74,1.8.2

Jalal Ahmed,"It was fun but the cost of each item is way too high then you can earn. I have to watch tons of video to gain money. But I did and build a 5 star hotel and moved to the new one. Now I figured out I can't use my previous balance to upgrade the new hotel. So you have to start again. If I think as hotel tycoon then I build my business, use my current fund to grow more. I have no energy and time to watch tons of videos again to earn money. So I am uninstalling it. Bu the game and features are good.",3,72,1.7.2
Petra Jacobsen,"Ok, so I really like this game. Fun graphics, cool mechanics, etc. I also don't mine watching ads for 2x profit or money. My problem however is that neither are working anymore. I can't watch ads for 2x profit or money. And it's very slow if you don't. I've tried backing out, reinstalling, restarting the app and my phone. Nothing works. Really hope this bug is fixed cause I really love this game",3,71,1.8.4
Lesley Tetley,"The game was fun at first, but it stopped connecting to ads all of a sudden and they won't come back. You pretty much need the adverts to advance so playing the game is pointless now. I'll be uninstalling by tomorrow unless it's fixed. EDIT: anyone having trouble with the game not connecting to ads, just uninstall and reinstall. You don't lose any progress. I have been doing this about once per day. It's a dirty trick they're using to get you to spend a fortune on an ad-free version of the game",1,70,2.6.1
Savannah K,"I like it, it's a lot better than those 'Idle' games, where those just get boring. Yes this has pay to play options but you can absolutely play without ever paying, I've worked my way through nearly the whole thing with no $ spent. It does have a lot of watch ads options to speed up the process, but it's actually not so bothersome for me with this one. Simple but addictive.",4,69,1.8.2
A Google user,"Great Game really easy to play and a brilliant way to kill a bit of time. I really enjoyed it, so much I paid for a manager (no ads, there were far too many otherwise), reason for only 2 stars, it's a very short game, I paid ¡ê10 for the manager, thinking more hotels would open up... nope, there are only 5 hotels in the entire game. If you do play this, don't spend money just power through the ridiculous number of adverts...",2,69,1.3.1
Hannah Jones,"Fun and addictive game. LOTS of ads, but if you watch them there's no stopping you from getting one star in the events if you put in the hours. More stars would require spending money. I disagree with other commenters who say cash should transfer over to other hotels - that would make the game too easy. I like the increasing degree of difficulty. I'm only on level 4 though. Customer service isn't very useful, when and if they respond (the game shortchanged me some gems).",4,69,1.7.2
A Google user,"Good game, as of yesterday I have completed all the hotels. Only scored so low because I must have watched over a 1000 ads during my time playing this game. For me, I would have it open while watching something and constantly have ads playing to actually make money in game. Another thing, once you've completed a hotel, there's no need to go back to it, it's just making money that you can't use. Guest pathing is a bit weird at times too, and the opening times of facilities is a bit off as well",3,68,1.2.1
A Google user,"I love this game, i really want more of it im so excited to see more added to the game. As soon as i possibly can im going to spend a lot of money into this game i want to see more things. To do more hotels, i just i love it so much from the graphics you use to the layouts of the buildings. 1 main question though do the purchases i make help the creator? Like support for the game and help live? Hopefully comfortably. I'll be trying to get my friends to play for sure they'd love it!",5,68,1.1.1

However, -3 stars as below: _ -1 star : seems like I played the ads more than the games itself _ -1 star : after upgraded all the 1st hotel facilities & hired max qty of employees, I only got 4 stars. The coins getting pilled up for 900k++ but I couldn't spend it at all. _ -1 star : even after I got those 900k++ coins, I couldn't use it at the 2nd hotel.

You're never forced to, but there's rewards so watch a million commercials and this game will go by quick for you. 3 complaints: 1) in-game purchases are stupid expensive.

Glenda Lea,"This game is lacking logic. It is so frustrating to see the NPC travel back and forth between amenities that our closed. This makes no sense! For instance, all guess will travel in pre-determined order from place to place (even when said place is closed) while your pool. By the time the arrive at the pool it closes. Therefore the hotel loses money. By the forth hotel guess don't even sleep anymore. They are just walking from place to place. I'm looking for something new. Any suggestions?",2,67,2.0
Anka D,"If you are willing to pay for ""addless"" version go ahead. If you're not willing to pay then don't even bother. The game is conceived to force you to watch ads otherwise you can't do anything. The progress is very slow without ads and you have nothing to do while waiting for funds to gather. Here skill is not required, you are just expected to watch adds to make the money you need to make the upgrades. Or you can pay and the income from the hotel becomes normal as it should be in first place.",1,67,1.8.3
Devon Martin,"Great game with fun progression and no necessary P2W. My only complaint: I have a maid glitched and stuck in a bedroom. She won't clean, and I can't fire her, so that room isn't getting cleaned and I have to watch a video to clean it every day. Anything you guys can do to help me out? It's the first hotel.

A Google user,"Excellent idle game for people with genuine business mind. More challenging than most idle games. You need to look at the cost/benefit of each upgrade to work out the order, because you can't just keep clicking everything like in so many games. Log in every 2 hours or so if you can and watch one add to double income, then spend the money upgrading. You can watch more adds for money but that gives you the best value for your time. Its slow progress but better than games that are far too easy.",5,66,1.5.0
Molly McG,"Great addictive game! But when you get to Santa's Shelter - 1. It's Summer. 2. The hours of the bar & restaurant are crazy, so you spend a lot of time (if not watching adverts to proceed) watching guests wander down to find them closed, then go back up to their rooms. Bored now. If you don't watch adverts, this game would take years to get through. Was fantastic, but I'd be great if you could make steady progress without hours of adverts.",4,66,1.7.1
Tall Aaron,"Special events are buggy!!! You see, when you play a special event you have 3 days to make 180m... Even after purchasing one if not all three extras (a total around $25) the game will be playing for you only to freeze and lose a whole days worth of profits. When trying to get to support, you just get a list of known problems. No way to reach out to anyone... Highly frustrating, not worth your time.",2,66,1.8.4
A Google user,"This game is very well polished with a great art style and easy to use interface. I had a lot of fun with the first two hotels, but ran into a big issue. Upgrades are priced such that you really can only progress through the levels in a very linear fashion. By the time you get to big upgrades like the ski slope, for example, you are making so much money you can upgrade it all anyway. This really makes things feel bland and eventually too boring.",3,65,1.4.2
Scott McGoogan,"The game is fun enough, but new hotels are very slow to start. Would be nice if you could share some of the money from other hotels to get off to a better start. Also, when you watch an ad to get double profits while you were offline, you don't actually get double the profits. It says on screen that you do, but when you check your balance, it only gives you the amount once.",3,65,1.9.93
Thor Bumbrey,"I was enjoying the game, but then I noticed the AI is horrible and makes you lose profit when you expand. When you purchase a major expansion to your property (such as the ski slopes) it actually cut the income of my hotel in 1/2 because the guest waste time walking out and around the building even when the ski lift is closed. By time they get back inside the other facilities are closed and you make a lot less because of all the time they walked around not spending money.",1,65,1.8.2
James Bridger,"Its a fun game that helps the time pass when I'm bored. But I've noticed when I watch the ads for ""double the cash"" when i open the app, it only does the original ammount.... so, literally watching the ad when I first open the app for no reason. Supposed to give double the money while I'm away but it keeps giving me the original amount. A 30 second ad isn't worth it lol (and yes I know ads keep it free but thats not the problem so please don't respond with that) please fix it.",4,64,1.8.4

Gradually more and more upgrade buttons kept popping up on my screen until I couldn't help but to accidentally press one and open up the pop up screen. Becomes so annoying I just uninstalled.

Joel Austin,"Very fun game... Ad issue appears to be fixed so I increased to 4*. Suggestion: the game should be move of a puzzle in a quest to make your hotels, 5*. There should be more options to make me have to find the most successful combo, plus more than 1 way to reach 5*.

Jake Mitchum,"A fun little time wasting game. I've honestly played it more than I care to admit. It's simple with concise goals, and allows you to play and win with minimal ads unless you choose to use them. I am hesitant to give higher than a 4 star because there are a few changes I would like to see in the app. For instance being able to zoom further out would be amazing.",4,63,1.8.1
A Google user,"It's fun but lacking. Just a few things I like: * It's cute. Pretty simplistic, but still very detailed. * The early stages of a new hotel are challenging. They force you to think strategically. Some things I dislike: * Way too short. There's only 5 hotels and then game over. * Late stages of a hotel are incredibly easy, but only if you're offline for the maximum time. It came down to me just getting the 10 hour offline time then doubling profits.",3,63,1.3.1
A Google user,"I was very hesitant about this game at first as most switch over to an advertisement every ten seconds. But within this one, you choose whether you want to watch them or not and in return, you get pennies and stuff to help expand your hotel. You can hire additional staff and choose to skip advertisements but still gain all the perks, but it's over ¡ê10 each for these amongst others which I think is a little high. But certainly doesn't stop me from being able to play the game which I'm enjoying.",5,63,1.3.1
Dr. Raphael B,"A fun and enjoyable game for individuals interested in entrepreneurial games. It helps pass the time, is easy to learn, and teaches one basic business aspects from micro-economics to accounting. May still need to take classes for taxes though (sorry folks lol).

Must be fixed. Also, some of the housekeeping staff in the crystal and the Arabian resorts are laying on their faces, instead of being seated or standing. haha. Please add more hotels. Events must be added as a service IN the hotels, not a hotel itself. Like a banquet department. Extend restaurant hours. 1h30 is not enough. I know it's a game but try to be more realistic ;) Too bad cannot be played on a computer.",3,63,1.4.2

Jim Esquivel,"The game is actually good and very accommodating. But the complaints are also true. The game stops giving ad after 5 mins. then, if you restart the game, it will leave you with only 2 customers in single room. Nit even enough to cover the wages of staff.

Manny G,"It's fun for awhile but when you get to the later levels everything is so expensive (TV for a room costs $30k) and there's nothing to do to pass the time and make more money. Plus you gotta watch an ad for any kind of boost, even if it's for a measly $1k that doesn't get you anything anyway. Plus they purposely set the hours to all add ons to keep you from making more money delaying the game. Why have a bar that opens at 9am, then closes at 4:30?",2,61,1.7.2
A Google user,Really enjoyed this game much more strategic than other idle games however it would be nice to have more than 2 hotels and when I got the 2nd hotel the main manager says the income from my first hotel might help me in the 2nd one yet not sure how.

I do wish you could transfer funds between hotels with a premium exchange rate or something (like AdCap) to add a bit more oomph to higher levels. Also, the ""events"" are terrible. There is next to no actual reward for participating. What the heck is with the 2 hour max idle collecting time?! On top of that, the ""boosters"" only work for that one specific limited time event. Disgusting money grab, if you ask me.",2,60,1.7.2

Kerr Elesterio,The game looks great and it's very well animated. My problem is that you basically play the game by watching ads. You earn instant cash just watching ads.

The only reason I haven't changednto 5 stars is that I've finished and there doesn't seem to be a way to reset the game to do it again, without wiping purchases (unless I've missed something which is probably the case). Also devs, any chance of more hotels being added? __",4,55,2.8
A Google user,"Overall, the game is good and the game play is smooth. I did note that the front desk sometimes stand backwards and a few times the services weren't there before the guests, but overall good game.

Ochako999,"okay here is the thing, after finishing one hotel then what? what will the money be used for? I need a feature where you can transfer the money from one hotel to another. Maybe you can add tax feature for each tansfer so it will be another challenge for us. But really, starting from the start again for other hotels. and everything is 10times difficult? Hmm sure but at least add the feature i asked you: to transfer money from one hotel to another. I watched ads but sometimes its not helping.",3,55,1.8.4
kishore sharma,"It's fun in the beginning, once you reach 5 star level that hotel is as good as junk, cause you can't use that money for any other hotel so it keeps getting accumulated. Basically the developer wants you to spend insane amount of money to keep adding my stars from the scratch for every new hotel. It will be fun for a couple of days and then you'll exit & delete this app.",1,55,1.8.4
Kathryn Lawrence,"I give it 4. The biggest isshue wasn't the adds themselves, I didn't mind watching them, but they never worked and kept crashing the game. The dog is worth it, only if you can't stand that. If there were more hotels, I would play for the event managers.... However, I would LOVE to see some more hotels! Japanese traditional inn (I would LOVE!), Russian hotel, a hotel with igloos, Indian hotel, Australian outback hotel, Mexican hotel, a cruse ship! This game has a lot of potential!",4,55,1.7.2
A Google user,"Played this game last 3 days nonstop and loving it. Only issue is blue crystal, where we get 4 double bedrooms, but when you go offline for a few minutes, it's always stuck at '2 rooms left' which is odd. The first two resorts were perfect. Its a slow pace game and makes you work, but its so satisfying when finishing. Hope you guys have more planned! I'm almost done with blue crystal! ______",4,54,1.1.1
A Google user,"Fun game, but there's just not enough currency in the game. It's nearly entirely ad based revenue. Each room only pays a tiny amount per hour, so you pretty much have to watch the VIP ads if you want to get anywhere fast. The game is fun, it's just really hard to play without constantly accepting the ads.",2,54,1.6.0
Jeremiah Johnson,"Game is fun, but not enough updates. There are to few hotels. You go through them and build them way to fast. The event is the same hotel over and over and over. If we could get more frequent updates for quality of life that would be great to. A buy max option would be real nice, I would even settle for a buy 5 at this point. Also there is not much of a difference in looks between hotels. A large variety of decor that fits the hotel would be nice. Instead it's the same bed and decor.",2,54,1.8.4
A Google user,"I like it very much! It really feels like I'm running a hotel and the animations are great and the game style is great. The only 2 things I would really want to improve the game is 1, when you look at stats and it tells you that you are losing money and in the negatives I think you could have the option to know why you're losing money. 2, I wish that the amount of money it takes to upgrade the generator was a bit lower, 16,000 dollars is a bit much for a beginner that's running out of power",4,53,1.1.1
Gregory Thomas,"Great concept for a game! Unfortunately you spend all your time watching ads and many of the ads crash or you don't receive the reward after watching. Each hotel gets more expensive to build the same things as well as having extras......a level is fun once you start making enough money to keep building but for the last few hotels it takes days of checking in every 2 hours to get it started. Also, many problems with customer AI.",2,53,1.8.4
Julie Gunter,"The game is a lot of fun, typical free-to-play money-grubbing antics. Too many pop ups asking you to pay real money for things, considering it's a FTP. My biggest qualm with it is that the dancing money man is broken. He works the first time, then after that he doesn't give a reward and keeps perpetually dancing until I restart the app. If/when they fix dancing man, I'll add another star.",3,53,1.7.2
Chris,"One of the suites shows the safe at a level 3 when the ithers are level 4 and is saying the room is 100% upgraded. Not sure how this can be when its not. when you upgrade the restaurant to the max and have it running as fast as you can, it still doesn't allow for all the people to eat food. Half of them turn away because there isn't enough people being able to sit down and queue so you lose out on revenue. Can this be rectified at all?",3,53,1.7.1
Michael Springer,fun game. but doesnt make sense why I cant zoom out. sucks I've gotten to the end of the game and it doesnt seem there will be anymore. and the hotel events are always the same hotel. great concept with a little more work this would be an amazing game. beat every level. it takes a little bit of time. but i can't keep playing the same event over and over we need new hotels. Months later and still waiting on a new hotel. About to uninstall this game.,1,53,1.8.4
Kyn,"Hi! Great game and all, I love the graphics, but once a hotel is finished, the money from that hotel just SITS there while other hotels could really be using that. I wish there was a button you could send money ever so often like every 24 hours you can send however much you want to which ever hotel. But other than that it's cool",4,53,1.9.93

This is on my top 3 list of games. Thank you for creating such a great game! I only have one question about this game. When the people leave the hotel, Were are they going? Do they go home? And i also like the animations they have. That's all.",5,53,1.3.1
A Google user,This is a nice game but not very logical. The only way to play the game is to watch an insane number of ads (basically the entire point of the game is to upgrade your hotel- you must watch videos to get money to upgrade ). I quit the game when I realized that money can not be shared between hotels (which makes earning money on a fully upgraded hotel pointless) not to mention the new hotels are twice as expensive. I wrote support & heard nothing. Glad I realized this before spending real money.,3,52,1.7.1
Zuma,"I actually enjoy the game but it has too many issues. Firstly it's an idle game but has a 2 hour limit. Secondly, even when I have a strong network connection, I can't watch ads even though I was watching them 5 secs ago. Thirdly, setting up your hotel without any outside force is impossible. With all these issues, it makes the difficult and lack luster.",3,52,2.3.3
Susanna Fiebiger,Love this game! The only down side is that after playing for a while I no longer get ads from the dancing man to get money rewards. So I have to uninstall and reinstall the game to get this feature back and then it disappears again and I have to repeat the process. Super annoying when I love playing this game so much!,3,52,2.0
Aderyn Bird,"Reeeeeeally needs new levels and it's been way more than a year since any substantial content updated. It's not even worth coming back to the app for special events because you physically cannot obtain a measley 1 star without spending a great deal of your day watching ad after ad to get any sort of cashflow. If I wanted to watch ads all the time, I'd put the TV onto QVC.",1,52,1.9.93
Sabrina DeAngelis,"I'm not sure how this game has good reviews. You make no money while the game isn't running - the only way to make enough is to watch ads.

However, random times when I touch the investment guy when he arrives, I touch to play video and video plays but then I don't get the money. It glitches, like it never happened. So I watched a preview for something, for nothing, frustrating.",4,51,1.3.1
Kody Koch,"This game has several great things about it. First I would like to say that for an idle type game, i actually had to pay attention to what i was upgrading or buying at first. there were a few times where I ended up negative in my income... until i fired everyone, lol. Secondly, I am really enjoying the way things change as they upgrade. Thirdly, moving on to the next hotel didn't mean a complete restart. Overall, a great idle game that requires some forethought!!!",5,51,1.7.1
Shwimp,"It's fun and relaxing. If you're playing this without paying any money, then it probably has too many ads. I went ahead and got the $10.99 ad free option and it's definitely a lot more enjoyable. I love the simplistic art style and upgrading things feels satisfying, keeping the game feeling fresh. Can't wait to advance further __",5,51,1.8.4
Mecero Albis,"I love Simulators. This one is a bit challenging. If you hate ads, this is not a game for you because it will be hard to advance fast if you don't watch ads. It's a 2 Star for me, I don't mind watching A LOT of Ads, but there have been MULTIPLE TIMES the reward was not given to me after watching the Ad and it bothers me a lot!! Specially the rewards with high amounts.",2,51,1.7.4

Edit - next level was better but now been waiting weeks for a new level, despite two updates.",2,51,1.5.0
Kimberley D,"I really enjoyed this game but after paying for the full upgrades, I'm a little disappointed that the game was quite short and does not seem to be receiving any further level updates.

After you get a hotel to 5 stars you keep getting money, but you can't buy anything there because you all ready bought everything in the hotel and you can't bring it to other locations making the money you make in a 5 star hotel useless.

Chloe Green,Great Game Goals are actually achievable with decent in play costs for new and upgrades. Money does take a while to accumulate but watching ads and gameplay with benefit this. Each levels difficulty raises but achievable. Keeps you interested in the level and coming back to play. Caught up with the developers and now waiting on the latest level. Actually spent money to skip adds it's that good of a game. I've actually restarted because I got a new phone,5,49,2.6.1
Megan Lee,This game would be awesome if it wasn't for the fact the ads hardly work anymore. Constantly having to restart the game or my phone just to watch a few at a time. It's a great idle game but if ads don't work then your only option is to pay for it and honestly it's not worth it at that point. If it's not fixed soon might just uninstall and find something else.,2,48,1.8.4
A Google user,"The game is very simple and competitive but soon the glory ends. The task for a hotel gets over soon and there is no more upgrade then the next hotel opens up, challenge starts. The already upgraded hotel will give earning a lot but you can't transfer the amount being earned to the new location. We have to start from the scratch in the new location. There could be more challenges and if there is any possibility of transferring the profits would be great.",4,48,1.7.1
FoxyKillz808,"I like this game very much, it's simple, yet actually fun and satisfying watching your hotel grow. I learned a lot like needing to have enough money to pay the workers by the time they leave or you have to rehire them. The music is calming. I also like that you have a choice to watch ads and actually get something out of it instead of just wasting precious time. Good job, whoever made this should get an A. But again this is my opinion. __",5,48,1.9.95
Allison Rutherford,"As fun as this game is, it's equal parts frustrating. 1. FIX THE PATHING ISSUE. My guests go to closed amenities constantly! Roaming the halls at 4am. 2. Let me turn off your pop ups for the event. Not interested. Doing to same hotel over and over is BORING! 3. Extremely lazy using the same hotel for Arabian Nights (which was great!) and reusing it for the next one. And no new amenities that weren't used previously. Don't even want to play anymore. I was ready to move on to something new.",3,48,1.9.97

Plus watching 3 minutes of ads for only an hour of bonus cash is far from worth it, let alone you can only stack that up To 2 hours (about 6 minutes of ads by the way). Don't get me started on how expensive the monetization is. It seems like a fun game that doesn't want me to play it so I won't.",1,48,1.2.2
Idk,"I've noticed that there's another review that describes the same problem I'm going through currently. The game is very fun. However, it requires watching ads to have a normal progress. The thing is that the ads no longer load for me and the ""dancing man"" no longer shows up either. It's a shame because the game has gotten a lot more boring with this issue. If you could fix this, great! __ If not, I'm afraid eventually I'll no longer feel the urge to play it and might uninstall.",3,47,2.5.1
Katey Belton,"I would give higher stars if the game actually kept my save data when switching devices. I had just gotten a new phone but all my saved data ""went out the window.""

Amadi Belleh,Not sure if this is a bug or something but I downloaded the game and tried to launch it and it seems to be stuck on the first screen before you get to a menu or options or anything. If this isn't a glitch then it's taking more then 5 minutes to get past the first screen before any game play happens and that is a ridiculous amount of time. I'm uninstall this which is annoying because I didn't get to play at all. If this bug is fixed I might redownload but right now I literally can't play it.,1,46,3.1
A Google user,"Great game, terrible progression. Once you finish the first hotel you get no reward like other tycoon games.

Violett Lesterman,"Great! Absolutely, in love with this game. It's interesting because you don't just constantly profit, you lose money too, which reminds you to always keep everything in balance, or even your staff may resign!

Twyla Maine,"I love this game! Got to spend hours ""in game"" to really get the benefits, but good game for anyone who can stay in game and give is 2 sec every 10 min. Have purchased twice no issues.

A Google user,"The game is fun, I enjoy playing it to kill time. But I think earning gems should be easier and there should be alternate ways to hire the Hotel manager and campaign manager.

A Google user,Great game! Very fun and relaxing.,5,46,1.4.2
A Google user,"The game is great, but I have two complaints. The first is that the permanent upgrades cost far too much. In your other games, there were opportunities to earn gems to spend on permanent upgrades instead of real money.

However, money seems to be separate between hotels. Money should be shared.",2,45,1.1.1

When the guy with money shows up (who I refer to as ""my sugar daddy"") I'm almost always clicking on him and watching the add, I needed to because for the first 2 hours or so there is no way you can make any profit. For example the kitchen with each chef the daily wage is $200 but, you are charging $13 per customer when you have 4 guests who eat 3 times a day you can't afford to pay the chef and have to hire a new one every 10 minutes.",2,44,1.8.4

I have effectively finished this game, and spent $11 I can longer enjoy at all.More stars when this game doesn't end, like it has for me. Also, think about adding the ability to max out an item if I have enough money to do so, so there's less button mashing.",2,43,1.3.1
Cody Palmer,"Unplayable game unless you are willing to watch ads consistently. Game honestly needs to be reviewed separately for the paid and unpaid versions. I highly recommend the ad-free version and would rate it 5 stars with the exception of the event in-game purchase offers. Like many other reviewers have said, the game is almost unplayable if you do not pay for the ad-free version. Revenue generation is extremely slow, which means that in order to progress, you must watch ads or spend real money. I have no issue spending money to support free games I enjoy playing. I purchased the ad-free version and enjoy playing it. There are in-game event hotels which are limited time. There is an option to buy a package for $11 that includes different perks including a VIP manager and hotel upgrades. The wording the developers use to promote the in-game purchase lead the player to believe the package will allow you to keep managing the hotel and continue to have access to the manager after the event period. Because why would anyone pay $11 for in-game perks that only last for 12 hours? The game does not explain the events and the associated purchases. The details are under options in the support tab which I only noticed after I realized I had paid $11 for nothing. As a new player, I wish I would've known that the in-game purchase would be only usable during the duration of the event. I feel that the developers have made the details and wording of the purchasable offers intentionally unclear.",3,43,1.8.3
Chrillex II,"It's by far,one of the best idle game I played. It's difficult in the first part but as time goes on,it gets more easier and challenging.I think the only minor issue of it is the fact that some guest in the double room don't want to sit together and take up one of the space.It's kinda annoying because the guest get's out of the hotel but the fact that the guest appearance is frequent so its kinda easy.So overall,a great idle game.",5,43,1.7.4
A Google user,"If you don't mind watching a lot of ads to get a great game, this game is for you!

A Google user,"Overall so far this game is 'okay'. Simple strategy to earn money, but the developers put the goals too high so you can't earn money quickly. It will take few days to earn some cash unless you are a hard player playing the game all day with your phone on.

Elizabeth Chambers,"So, I had this game a while back. I really enjoyed it. Then it started getting all ""glitchy."" I uninstalled it. Missed it and reinstalled it. Now it's in perpetual ""loading"" mode to see an ad. It's not a real ""idle"" game either, because when I leave the game, the hotel stops working. I'm about to uninstall, again. Fix this, please!",1,42,1.9.7
Sylvain Lecours,"Really nice idle game. Looking forward to new hotels. Please make the event hotels more varied. Like a beach one, or a sports one. Looking forward to see the evolution of the game.

New upgrades, or so advantage to getting revenues from them to finance another hotel maybe?",4,42,1.7.2
Hidden Blindspot,"This is a surprisingly fun game, but be forewarned. As far as gameplay goes, it's a marathon and not a sprint. It can take days to make headway with revenue and for those wanting fast results, unless you're willing to pay up, you may be disappointed. A few thoughts. First, how about allowing outside guests to use the facilities? Second, what would happen if a hotel had to be created from scratch using revenue from other hotels? Third, if at 5-stars, turn off ""!"" for the optional suites.",4,42,1.7.4
AkWingnut,"WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT PLAY!!! Game play was nice, however it comes to an end. Once the hotels are done there are no more hotels.

Update or allow players to start over with increased benefits.",1,42,1.8.4

The game itself is great though. :)",4,42,1.8.4
A Google user,"One of the few games that you can play without watching ads or paying money. It is up to you to watch ads to get extra money or pay a little bit to have no ads but you still get the benefits. So far the game is entertaining and helps to pass the time.

Achilles Vee,"I love this game so much. Codigames is the only dev that I trust that can make a really good idle tycoon game.

Raincie Comper,"I still really like the game but it's really annoying that I spent money on the permanent 2x money and they turn that off for the non permanent codi resort hotel. If I had known I probably wouldn't have got it. Seems like a waste to me since once I finish all the hotels there's no other reason to have it. Other than that, it was still fun to play.

Jaco Marais,"Can you please reduce the price for premium to $7.50? I will buy it then. At the moment it is to expensive.

Dave Taylor (Laird of Lochaber),"I enjoyed the game at the start and paid to remove the ads, but has become very repetitive. I even paid for an upgrade during an ""event"", which happen every few days. Won't buy any more as this has become a moneymaking exercise. Also there are limited hotels.

I will be uninstalling when finished last hotel.",3,41,1.7.1
Isabella Millauer,"I had to take back as many stars as I could because I am deeply disappointed with the developers. I purchased the package available during the events that was a hefty 17 euros for me, and they give the upgrades only for this one event that lasts for four days.

I do not want to play this anymore. Deleted all your games.",1,41,1.2.1
Jasper Zatch,"Really loving this game, it is one of the first phone apps ive spent money on(removed ads dog). Only complaint ive had while playing is that the AI of the customers needs work, their stupidity limits the money I make when playing actively due to their wasting of time by walking back and forth to closed places, which is only made up by the dancing king(sometimes). It's a major issue, but is pretty good otherwise. Will update this review over time.",3,41,1.8.3

I don't know why but the app keeps on crashing, I've uninstalled it then reinstall again but the same problem still occurs. The other games I have on my phone are working well. Do you have any suggestions to what should I do? Because I seriously don't want to permanently uninstall this app.",4,41,1.8.4
Dionne Dewayne,"This game sucks, it has videos to help add money to your wallet,while you wait. This money is given by watching ads. Sad part, it only works 20% of the time. Sometimes it gives a nice reward, majority of the time it doesnt work. It will start the ads then, they will disappear and you wont get rewarded. Sometimes they freeze then you have to restart the game. My other games dont freeze up at all even during the ads. I believe this is just to cheat you out of money and upgrades!",1,40,1.8.4
A Google user,"Fun game. I've completed all the hotels, so that speaks for itself. I'm keeping the app too just in case you add more hotels. My only critiques is that it could use more of a storyline. Maybe obstacles to overcome?

They are just suggestions. Good going guys!",5,40,1.2.0
Tanmay Agrawal,"Worst game, why? 1) A lot of bugs, example you won't get the rewards sometimes after watching add. 2) This brings to my second point, that it just a game with add baits and high prices to buy add free. 3) They have a feature that you can start with a special even and a new manager/influencer can be earned, but they throw an impossible task that can only be accomplished by spending money. Basically they try to force you spend money to progress in the game",1,40,
Alex Manning,"A really nicely made idle game - the pace is more realistic than many others I have played, the guest movements are a nice touch and there is a genuine balance between income and expenses. One suggestion I have is to dim the lights in any unsold/unoccupied rooms so that its easier to spot at a glance once check-in has ended which have failed to sell.",5,40,1.8.4
Debanjali Das,I love this game...but the Codi Resort Hotel way of earning managers to continue the game even when I am offline is bad. They don't give us money enpugh for making upgrades for earning money...and all are to be bought with money. At least let us use our money from the old fully upgraded hotel. We have huge stacks there and would be helpful if we could use our money from other hotels to upgrade in the Codi Resort Hotel.,4,40,1.9.93
Just Dave,"The game is almost exactly what I want from this genre. Worth the price for Ad-free. Ads are all optional, but you progress much faster not having to watch them. Upgrade system is on point. Reason for 4 stars is because there is no system for utilizing hotel profits from a hotel you have fully upgraded. There is no incentive to bother with already upgraded hotels because you can't use any of the money, anyway. If this changes, it will get the 5th star.",4,39,1.7.2
A Google user,"I really love this game. It's super addicting and not to hard to progress in. It's good to play during some downtime. However, I think that the money you make should be transferrable or shared between hotels. It sucks that I don't have enough money for the hotel I'm working on, but the hotels I've already maxed out just have money sitting there that I can't use. I think having a transfer system would greatly improved the game.",4,39,1.3.1
Jessica Lattimore,"I like this game, I enjoy the simplicity of the game design but it gets boring after a while. What could improve the game is adding in a challenge component.

K C,"The game was great to start off with. There was a consistency in new hotels to work though. With the update to the event hotels, it seems like the amount of new non event hotels has lessened, and the event hotels are difficult to pass. With the first one I purchased the presidential pack, and still didn't complete the set by the end of the 3 days. When I didn't purchase a set, I barely made a dent. I don't really bother with the event hotels because of this.",3,39,1.7.2

A Google user,"This game is 100% ad based if you want to keep it on the free version, which is perfectly fine by me! You have the option to pay to get rid of the ads and keep the rewards, if you choose. The cons are - 1. Sometimes a video won't play when you're expecting a reward, so no reward. 2. When you have a full hotel, if you close the app or switch to another hotel and go back, you somehow lost half of your customers. 3. No transferring funds to/from hotels. Other than that, it's a very addictive game!",3,38,1.3.0
yanwc,I paid to remove the ads. But if you dont want to watch the ads you don't have to. It's addictive. Hope update to the next hotel comes soon.

Ameera B.,"Enjoyable and addictive! But rated it 4 because the game is so easy, especially when you watch ads. Theres no challenge, just upgrade the hotel and generate profits. Once your hotel is 5 stars making tons of money, theres nothing left to buy so money adds up for nothing. However when you buy a new hotel your money starts from zero again.

Ayush Sakhi,Game is superb but only one thing that is very bad that it has very low money generation compared to all expenses and everytime i leave and back then i was in loss . Plz fix this And one request that you must provide landscape mode for playing this type of games .,1,35,1.9.95
Thato Tony Lerothodi,It's very nice game and interesting but after completing the other hotels there is no use of going back to it even though they still continue to run and make more profit could've been better if u can borrow money from the other profitable hotels to use on the new ones instead of starting from scratch and there will be no use of the money made from the already existing profitable hotels.,4,35,1.8.1
A Google user,"Nothing more than an ad delivery device. About every minute or so, it is presenting some reason for you to watch an ad. And now, it's gotten to the point where even if I agree to watch the ad, no ad actually shows, so no reward. And $10+ just to keep the game running idle for more than 2 hours? Really? The depth of play nowhere near justifies the pay-to-play upgrades.",1,34,1.2.0
Cheese,"Love this game. Absolutely no forced ads however if you want extra financial earnings you can watch them for a good amount. The ads generally aren't super long either unless they're uncommon 30 second ones to show up. The game for me was a tad laggy, especially once I started upgrading a lot of stuff, but overall the best tycoon game developers I've seen so far",5,34,2.5
Ito Dory,Main reason i give the game a 3 star is due to the bug this game has. For some reason when you leave the game running in the background it won't countdown your time or build up your profit after leaving the game alone. You have to completely close the game and reopen it but even that sometimes doesn't work and you're not able to to get your reward for coming back to the game. Please can you fix this issue it's tedious and annoying.,3,34,1.8.4
GT,"It is alright but I actually want to start a hotel like no objects is there from the start and that you get to choose where to put the objects. How ou can do the tutorial is just have enough money from the start to buy a counter. Then they pay you enough money to make a room and make it evolve. I know I'm asking a lot for you but I'm begging you, please listen and understand my advice. My opinion A fan",3,34,1.7.1
A Google user,"I love the game, it was the only thing I wanted. Half a year ago I was searching for a hotel tycoon but all I ended up with was some kind of bUiLd YoUr oWn CiTy, like townscape and now that this game came out I was so happy!

What isn't fine is there's no wait time listed not even an idea of how long things will be handled and in my case, it was 3 days. ANYWAY, people who buy on this game are making you money. Remember that, developer when you're leaving halfway smarta$$ replies.",1,34,1.9.8
Lauren Zableckis,Update: after posting this review the problem got solved quickly and the game is back to being very fun! Just a little bit buggy. I'm hoping the problem stays fixed The game was fantastic until the ads stopped working. I loved it but now it's incredibly slow and not very fun. I didn't mind watching the ads and they sped up the game to a good pace. Now they won't load and the game is very slow.,4,33,3
A Google user,I really enjoy playing the game it is great. However I recently got to the second Hotel and problems are starting to occur. 1. Anything that is ad related will close the game at times. 2. The button for the boosters won't function at times as well. 3. The game will only keep in game guests checked-in the single bed bedrooms. Once you exit and return to the game the two bedrooms will be unoccupied. Like I said I enjoy the game but these glitches make the game a bit upsetting to play with.,3,33,1.2.1
RabbidRaccoon44,poorly made cash trap. played through most of the hotels in the game and it's taken months. cool concept at first but not worth the little space it takes up on the phone. not to mention the bugs. you can return to older hotels but theres no point at all considering you have to get 100% done with each hotel to even get the next one. edit - in one of the last hotels and I'm permanently stuck making -3k a day. great game. I'm honestly ashamed I spent the amount of time I have on this.,1,33,1.9.91
Troy T,"Keep having to close the game out! Everytime the ads stop working the housekeepers get stuck and game play is no longer worth the time!!!!! I wouldn't be so agitated over this if I was using an old device, however, my device is brand new, which means the game needs to be fixed so people can play it. I hope this is taken seriously as I love playing this game, but it seriously needs to be fixed to work properly. At the moment this game isn't even worth one star.",1,33,2.1
Whar Nisbet,I enjoyed this game yes I paid to get all the bonuses .. it was a little more expensive than I like but well worth it the game is so much more enjoyable. My only concern in I'm worried I will beat the game and it will run out of levels. I would also like to see a bit more flexibility in what you can do with guests but otherwise thoroughly enjoying playing this as a past time.,5,33,1.8.2

Sometimes I've watched the video and gotten the money, then it crashes and I lose it. Sometimes it doesn't even black out the screen to take me to the ad and The VIP has turned to leave, then it crashes. Lastly, when it crashes it kicks the people out of 2 rooms, even if it's night. (Always 2). I'd like my VIPs back...",3,32,1.5.0
A Google user,"Fun for 10m but it quickly gets old. I also felt it did not do a good job explaining rating system. Felt this game was very unrewarding for the hours of ads I had to watch and the constant grind, literally everything needs an upgrade on top of an upgrade. I was finally done getting to 5 stars on 1st hotel after prob 4-6 hrs. After all that time and resisting the obvious cash grabs to skip ads it just reminded me how unplayable pay- to- time-skip mobile games are.",1,32,1.5.0
Prateek T,"I've been playing this game for over a year now and its been engaging. But I would love to pool in all the money from all hotels, that can bring in the feel of a hotel tycoon. Codigames should introduce hotels based in different countries and can develop the hotel portraying the culture of different countries and different regions. This would bring in actual feel of being a hotel tycoon. I would just like to know when is the new hotel update coming up??",5,32,1.7.3

Supernova,"Game is overall fun with quite few bugs and hard parts. I'm on the 5th hotel currently and it's still as fun as the 1st one. The biggest and most annoying bug I've come across is that after the ""dancing man"" arrives to offer me an ad for video and i watch it, after he leaves, his icon pops up on the right of my screen in order to watch another video for more money. I never seem to get any of that money and sometimes the dancing man's money also doesn't get delivered. Not sure what's at fault.",4,31,2.4
Skully Jackal,"Good fun little game, worth buying the no ad upgrade if you can afford it though. I'm already in the last hotel.. kinda wondering what happens after that, as finishing that negates the point of doing the event hotels. Editing this nearly a year later, still no new hotels!

Chris Cannon,"I wish it wasn't quite so focused on ads as a part of the active play. In order to advance quickly with the app open you need to watch adds to get perks that would otherwise take a while to get; I would just enjoy it more if the ads weren't nearly as necessary. Other than the vast quantity of ads, the gameplay is very fun and rewarding! Excellent concept!",4,30,1.7.3
Hannah Utain-Evans,"Great graphics and addicting game play. All the shiny reminders of things to buy can be annoying and really take up the screen. Biggest issue is tha the profits from one hotel can't be spent on another--once I've reached 5 stars, what's the point of even collecting the profits? Isn't that the basis of a business empire???",4,30,1.8.4
Sandra Dee,I like the game! I enjoyed playing the game until about halfway through the third hotel! At a certain point the investor stopped coming and I am unable to watch ads to double my income. This makes the game move too slowly as upgrades are extremely expensive compared to what you are accumulating in the game. I am at a point that I cannot do anything without double income or investor perks.,2,30,1.9.93
Nancy Abdelmeseh,"The game is fun but very very very glitchy. The ads don't play. I either have to force stop the game or uninstall-install it again. The investor doesn't come as well, unless I uninstall the game then get it back, that trick only works for the first time i open the game after re-installing it. If i watched a video successfully to double the profit, when i exit out of the game the doubled profit goes away. If I had all rooms occupied, once i leave the game i come back to find half rooms empty.",1,30,1.9.8
Colleen SDragon,I thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish! The first time I've ever played a game like this and now I'm a fan. I'll keep this one on my phone to delete and replay in the future. I did pay the extra $10+ for ad free and another $10+ for the manager later in the game. Neither is neccessary. I was simply enjoying the game so much that I decided to enhance the experience and I would have spent that much on a movie and snacks which would not have lasted as long or entertained me as much,5,30,1.8.3
Ray Wood,At the bottom of the screen is the VIP campaign where you have to watch a 30 second advert to get 10 minutes of 2 x's play. Click on watch video then come out of the game and go back in. You don't have to watch the advert and you'll get 10 minutes double play each time you do it up to 2 hours. I don't think it work's anywhere else in the game but it definitely work's on VIP campaign.,2,30,1.8.4
A Google user,So far I really do love this game. I definitely can't wait for more hotels to come as I have finished the first hotel and fully upgraded it so for now my money is just building up and I hope when the new hotels come I get to keep it all instead of losing it like most of the games that are like this. This is an awesome game just watching the rooms change when you upgrade them brings me fun to see the differences they have with each upgrade.,5,30,0.2.1
A Google user,"This game is a lesson in how NOT to do addictive phone games. I've finished the game not once but TWICE now after their ""additional content"" amounted to 1 more hotel. Top tip CodiGames - if you're going to make a game this addictive, at least have a ton of content ready to go *before* you release it. Now I'm sat around waiting for them to catch up. The game itself is great and well thought out - but ¡ê10 just to keep the hotel open for 10 hours is outrageous given the issues above.",2,30,1.3.1

Also, they charge way too much for the removing adds and other extras. 100% of the apps I've played, which is a ton, they charge about $1.99 or $1.95 to remove adds. The other perks are also way too expensive. I would understand if it was $2 or $3 dollars. I also wish that when you max out one hotel, you could transfer up to half that money to another hotel where you really need the money. GG though",3,29,1.2.1
A Google user,"Pretty fun game so far. Love the concept and game play and the fact I can own and have multiple locations. But since were not able to use profits from our other hotels to build on our new locations, we have to watch ads to generate extra cash and watching Ads for little hotel money is pretty ok but half the time the money isn't even added to my balance.

Mary Of Taber,"The best tycoon game I have ever found. I bought the no-ads, which made it PERFECT. And unlike some games, it didnt cost me a lot just to remove ads.

Steph David,"I really enjoyed this game at the start! I'm now on the 3rd hotel and am now deleting the app... the dancing man does not work most of the time which is extremely frustrating as you have to watch ads to pretty much progress in the game. This doesn't bother me too much, but the fact it crashed all the time is so dumb. Also when I switch to look at my older hotels and then go back to my current one, the guests have disappeared.",2,29,1.7.2
*,"Yep same as everyone else .. finding the game very fun and I don't mind having the option to watch ads, you get a reward and it isn't forced on you like some other games. However, why do the ads stop? And limit to once a reload? It's silly to reward us for a while then take it away? Just makes me want to stop playing, especially because when you start a new hotel the little gold man with free money helps a lot! Please fix... plus more ad revenue right?",3,29,1.9.7
A Google user,"I like the basic idea of the game, but what frustrates me is that the game is at first incredibly slow to play, you get double profits for only 10 minutes if you watch one ad and some ads don't even do anything.

I have now completed all of the hotels and awaiting a new one __",4,29,1.8.4
T L,Really fun game until it crashes. It stopped connecting to ad videos and no VIP turns up even though I've tried closing the app etc. It's so frustrating because the upgrade were designed to have to use the ads to get money $ if not I'd have to wait a whole day or two just for one upgrade. I'm not doing that. What a shame and waste of time.,2,29,2.3.2
Christhel Ritaga,Great but not satisfied. When you move hotels the customers will be gone when you came back. Also the chef wage is 180 but if you have 2 chef it will be 1080? Skipping tutorial is nice because you can just literally learn while playing but you should have an option for help for others that is very forgetful. You can't bring the money earned in the first hotel so basically it's nonsense to go back. This game has potential. Please fix all the bugs. Thanks,5,29,2.4
Lauren Holmes,"Love this game, however quite often if you come out of the game and then some time later go back into the game, the game will be stuck on the moment you left the game, which means your hotel didn't earn money while you were away. Also, if when you're watching a video for some extra money and accidentally click your screen and the ad takes you to the play store/apple store it cancels out the reward from the video. Such a shame as this is a good game.",3,29,1.7.2
Kristie Carr,"This game doesn't save progress very well. If I am playing it and get my hotel full of guests and then my phone goes dark even for a second, it gets rid of half of the guests I had.

Jonathan Johannessen,"500 characters is not enough to summarise my thoughts on the game. It is annoyingly fun and addictive, but so terribly lacking in the way of polish. Flawed mathematics, annoying bugs, little realism, a lack of continuity between idle and active play and the list goes on. Ads aren't obtrusive and don't appear without the user's input which is a plus.",2,29,1.7.3

Reagan Kamryn,I loved this game becuase you can play it all day and it almost never gets old. One thing I didn't like about it is you can't create like your own account so if you break your device you have to restart or re-do all of your progress.

Ian T,"EDITED: I loved it at first, slow but I like it for that reason... however, I got to the second hotel and I quickly realized that the game had a bug where the cleaners would constantly ignore rooms or stand in the rooms they are cleaning and stare at the walls forcing me to restart the game. I also realized that in order to get 5 stars in a hotel you have to BUY all the gem items. Not a problem until you realize you need 9 stars to get hotel 3.

Zykora Haverkorn,"I love this game and have been using it as a pass time for many months, but there are glitches starting to happen in the game. The ads wont load, the guy who comes to give you money just up and leaves and the game will freeze at times. These make it really hard to play expecially with the events.",3,26,1.9.9
Daniel Sykes-Brown,"There's some control issues with the game, and if you don't buy the no ads feature then it's a rough start, but the game is enjoyable. No ads is $11, so if you want a cheap(ish) game to burn some time then I recommend it, but otherwise you might want to go somewhere else if you don't want to spend the money. Not cheap for a mobile game for no ads, but as a game it's cheap.",2,26,1.8
A Google user,I really REALLY enjoy the game but I think there are some things that would make it better. 1) allow us to use the money from previous hotels on the NEW ones we open AND use them on the EVENTS to be able to attempt to complete the events. 2) if we want give the options to use our diamonds to purchase money if #1 isn't going to happen. 3)[not really a suggestion more of a question] are the packages that are available for the events are they available for entirety or not?,3,26,1.7.1
Mz Mc,"Update: May 2021 Completed all Hotels, hope there will be more hotel levels. 2020 Review Addicting Game, love the updates. Wish their was opportunities to get instant cash fast, something like how you watch ads to double your profit for 2h. Other then that its an addicting game to play, keep up the updates. Recommend this game for sure.",5,26,1.9.9
Kailash Singh,I love this game :D. It have many hotels to manage and events in between too. I've been playing from just 3-4 days and it is ver fun. I really recommend to play this :).,5,26,1.9.97
L Scorpio,"Game is decent. I've played other tycoon games, but this is the first mobile one I've played, so I expected some ""roadblocks"". However, the game is WAY too slow, and watching an ad will only speed it up for ten minutes...although you can increase that watching multiple adds. And the generator should be putting out more power then it does...or some items should be using less. Either way it doesn't feel balanced to me. I can't see myself playing for much longer.",2,25,1.8.1
A Google user,"Cute Game to pass the time with; however, it was too easy to beat. I've had this game less than a month and already fully upgraded all the hotels. I hope they plan on coming out with more soon. One annoying thing, is as soon as you close the app it tells you the hotel closed, I figured out it was just to get back into the game - I just waited until I got the all hotels are closed message (every 2 hours). Small thing to note, I hate ads so I bought that add on.",4,25,1.2.1
David Roberts,"Giving it a 2 bc the game is one of the better check out the app a few times a day depending on how much I feel like playing. It was enjoyable. Now that I've made some progress and got to the 2nd hotel it seems like the game is working hard to make me pay. The cash for an ad character shows up much less frequently, which I sort of get. But now the ad only plays like 20 percent of the time so you don't get the reward nearly as often. Seems like they're trying to get me to buy the no ads feature.",2,25,1.9.91
Bar__ Bozlaker,"It is an ok game and somewhat fun to play, but the game is lacking some complexity and flexibility. It's pretty straightforward, and most of the times all you can do is wait for money to accumulate or watch ads or pay money. There is no real threat of bankruptcy, and wrong choices only affect the time you need to play to complete the tasks and get 5 stars for hotels. I understand that this is a very casual game, but come on, tycoon type games need more complexity.",3,25,2.8
Julie Port,"Love this game, wish there were more hotels. The graphics are cute. The balance between ads was fine for enjoyable game play (and it is an idle game, so meant to run over time passively) but I enjoyed it so much I bought the no ad upgrade. In game I wish there was an upgrade all function, once you get the hang of creating successful hotels its frustrating to upgrade each item individually. Preferred this over the prison game as I like to make people happy :)",4,25,1.8.4
Gwen_5.1,"It was a fun game but I would really appreciate it if the hotel had some bad scenarios to add to the fun. As you play the game, it will start becoming boring to a state where you won't want to enter the app as it isn't fun anymore. All you need to do is just wait for the money and then upgrade things. It would be much more fun by adding exciting scenarios like, the hotel got broken into, the hotel closed down, the hotel went broke or the hotel had a fire. It would really be a better game.",3,25,1.7.3
A Google user,"It's an OK casual game, but you need to watch a lot of ads to get anything out of it, also only 5 hotels to complete so done relatively quickly. The events are also impossible without spending a lot of money, which I'm not doing, especially if my other hotels are fully completed so the bonuses wouldn't be that much benefit anyway. If there were more hotels so I could keep playing I might rate higher.",3,25,1.4.2
Eboney Jones,I love tycoon and idle games. I found this game after playing idle miners. Although i enjoy it. I have a couple issues! 1 being the money from your other hotels doesnt transfer over. After buying all the upgrades there is just money piling with nothing to spend it on. 2. Its only 1 way 2 earn diamonds 4 special items. that wouldn't be a problem if there were enough task 2 get them. It would be nice to use the money at my old hotels in the new one since i cant spend it at the old ones,2,25,1.8.3
Donna Montagna,Just finished building my first five star hotel and noticed that I can't use my profits from this hotel in my next one. I'm done upgrading this hotel so it will just stand there and collect money for nothing! I don't understand how the developers thought - it's like you have to restart the game Everytime you finish a hotel? It's too bad because I don't feel motivated at all to build another hotel that will just stand there and collect money without use. Fix the bug and the game will be super!!!,2,25,1.9.9
A Google user,It's a good game. Its challenging and there's a lot to do. But I don't understand why the money you earn from your previouse hotels can not be used for another hotel you started. That doesn't make any sense especially when you have nothing left to update on the previous hotels. All of the money on your old hotels just stock up and you don't even have anything to put it towards on that hotel because everything is completed yet you can't use it towards a hotel you are starting.,5,25,1.4.2
A Google user,"The ""idle"" time. It is only 120 minutes. for every 10 minutes of ""idle"" you need to see a small advertisement. 12 commercials for 120 minutes of idle. I can't go through level 3. for nothing I made all the changes I don't have 5 stars I spent all the diamonds in front of no purpose. it seems that I should still buy diamonds to be able to pass the level I think the game is made in such a way that without buying you can not pass on level 3.",1,25,1.2.0
A Google user,I really love this tycoon game! However I do have a complaint that the guests never spend time in their rooms! You put so much stuff for them to do in the rooms yet all they do in their rooms is sleep. I get that them using all the attractions gets you money but it's still a waste to add so much into a room and it's never used,4,25,1.3.1
Rachelle Lybarger,"The game is a lot of fun, especially if you pay to get the ads removed; however, I'm now at the end of the game and there's nothing left to do. There aren't any more hotels and I'm not even sure they are going to add more. There's also not a way to reset the game. It's also unfortunate that you can't transfer money from one hotel to another. Each hotel, you have to start with nothing but everything is a lot more expensive to buy the further you get into the game so it takes awhile to earn money",4,25,1.9.8
Wayne Sharp,"I've only been playing this game for a short period of time.. but here is my honest take away from the game play. I have enjoyed the game for the most part, and haven't seen the issues with the ads. Probably because I decided to support codigames and spend 10 bucks to avoid watching ads. My biggest issue with the game is that there is no AI built into the guests.. i watch a guest mosey clear across the hotel to get to the restaurant that opens at 730. The guest walks away at 728",3,25,1.8.2
A Google user,"Fun, but glitchy. Half the time when you click on the investor and then click ""Watch Video"" the video screen flashes and he walks away without giving anything. Pretty annoying. Other than that it's nice to slowly build and become profitable. Unfortunately after you Max a hotel it becomes pointless unless I'm missing something. Wish there was a way to use the millions of pointless money.",3,24,1.2.0
Andrew Newman,"Very enjoyable game, can sit and play constantly for hours on end... However it seems after the game has been played for a small amount of time the videos for bonuses stop working and the game starts to become very slow and difficult to grow on. Had to uninstall and reinstall just to get them to work again. Unfortunately the problem reoccurred after a day of playing and have had to do the same again",4,24,1.9.9
A Google user,"Feeling more like the game creator was just in it for money. The amount of ads you have to watch just to keep your income somewhat flowing is insane. The upgrades tap out easy so there isn't much of a way to earn higher income, a combined income would be better. I finished most of the second hotel upgrades and I'm finding it incredibly dull just watching ads(10.99 to stop ads), which is the majority of the game. Eventually you have to pay to finish the game anyway. Cute graphics though.",3,24,1.2.1
A Google user,This game has a lot of glitches that started to get worse the farther you get into it. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for that it's an awesome game please fix the little bugs. Some movies don't play when you expect an award for watching it. And the third board all of the guest are not going to room it's simple I think that can be fixed. Fix the bugs on the videos. Think I am going going to delete the game it cheats you out of money from that supposed to earn for watching the videos.,2,24,1.3.0
A Google user,"It was really good until we got to the last one, Santa's Shelter. Very disappointing. I played this and paid for benefits just to get to Santa's Shelter. Not worth it if you are looking forward to something cute and festive. This hotel is literally the first hotel. Just with a touch of a christmas wreath and a christmas tree. Not worth. Waste of time. Also the star ratings only go up once you've upgraded everything in your hotel. I would expect it to be based off the likes of customers.",2,24,1.2.0
Ollie R,"45 second adverts are not acceptable. I want to like this game but it's just so buggy, whether that's people flying through walls or logging in at 2am to find everyone starts wandering down to breakfast or the spa. Basically the exact same bugs as in prison tycoon. It's also really tedious that most levels need 100% completion before being able to move to the next.",2,24,1.8.4
A Google user,"I've been playing this game for months now, and all of a sudden I can no longer plan ads, and since I will not pay $10.99 to have the ads removed completely, I am now STUCK. I don't appreciate whatever change was made in the last update, because now nothing works! I am terribly disappointed because I loved (note the past tense) this game. Fix it please! And to Codigames, don't comment ""send a message to us"" because I ALREADY DID!!",1,24,1.4.0
Samantha Tarver,The game is a good way to pass the time. Its a little time consuming and a slow build but not horrible. My issue is with the purchasing. I buy the VIP packs for the events and I have been charged double at times or I have been charged but did not receive the pack. I have contacted support but I have not received any help. The events are time based so that is a problem.,1,24,1.9.93

Sumi Kitamura,"I'm only rating two due to the fact... 1. Fun game and time killer 2. Very very slow paced 3. Trickery... you have you buy gems to progress. Meaning, you can easily obtain 4 stars for your hotel via cash, but the other star is obtained via gems, just2 unlock the hotel's require stars gathered from others. For example, spend 20 gems for a tablet in one room, you have 6 rooms first hotel. So if you want to progress you have to buy gems. That's just the rooms, there is still the bar and kitchen...",2,24,1.8.4
A Google user,Codi is back on track with a quality game. Bugs have been fixed and loving the new hotels. I wish there was a way to channel money between hotels.

A Google user,"I do love this game! It's a great time passer and although you must use your money wisely, it isn't impossible to earn. The only negatives I have are that it's unclear how to change negative income. Also it drives me insane seeing the SAME ad OVER AND OVER. The ads are not extremely long, and always give you a reward in return, however it would be nice seeing ads for other apps too.",4,23,1.2.0
A Google user,"Okish. The game is fine, but the progression is really slow. They want you to focus on buying, or ads which there are a lot of. You really have to rely on the 2x multiplier if you want to progress, but you have to watch a 30 second ad to get 10 minutes of it. The power ups you can purchase, but for the price of 5-15$ wouldn't you just go get a solid game instead? Tycoons are fun for a bit, but I would never see myself paying so much to play a game without ads.",2,23,1.1.1
A Google user,"The game is perfect the graphics, style and the gameplay are good wish all Idles game (idle supermarket..) was at the same quality as this one. I have a question what we can do whit the money we earn from the previous hotels? We can't use it once we reach 5 stars! It will be good if we can use it in the development for the others hotels or at least a 50% of the sum or something like this! Thank you to find a solution for this problem and to make games like this .",3,23,1.3.0
A Google user,"Good game. Not too difficult to progress, its achievable, which is great especially for an app like this. No requirement at all to purchase anything or buy gems. Only thing i would suggest is it would be good to control check in and check out times, be able to accept or decline bookings dependant on how many nights/people are staying in a room or be able to hold them in hotel until checkout - be able to control opening hours of facilities and staff wages. Good app but needs more hotels!",5,23,1.2.1
A Google user,"This game honestly it's great. But the issues that I have with this game is that Its so hard to move up, you basically have to keep watching ads to get money and upgrade your stuff because the money that you're getting from your hotel just is NOT enough because you have to pay your chefs, check in person, and your house cleaning people and you pay them WAY MORE than you'd actually get.",2,23,1.1.1
A Google user,"I really enjoy the game, brings me back in time when we were playing all sorts of tycoons. But there's one thing that doesn't work for me... When I fill the 5 stars it becomes useless.

Or else u can just delete because it gets repetitive and boring...",1,23,1.2.1
Brandon Kaiser,"Love everything EXCEPT that hotels are meaningless after completion. Like everyone else who has played this game is asking: please let us transfer money from hotel to hotel or make it one pool of money that we can spend anywhere.

Such a small fix with such a huge implication.",4,23,1.7.1
Naomi Cann,"I love this game. But I noticed that with all the chefs hired, they still cant serve everybody or the amount of people that can be seated in the restaurant. Also, its the same with the parking. The parking is not enough for the amount of rooms I have. My last complaint is that in the beach hotel, the rooms on the right side do not match the left side. This causes my guests to go to the other rooms to use the bathroom. And they use the chair and desk without actually sitting in them.",4,23,1.8.4
Anon Ymous,"Fun but definitely pay to win, cards you can buy with real money only drastically boost offline rewards time, profits, no ads, etc. Not needed to play, and highly recommended against purchasing them as these levels are finite and after not a very long time that stuff you have paid for(insanely overpriced fyi) will literally be pointless as you will have ""beaten"" all the levels. Yes they are creating more, but nonetheless I feel the pay2win cards are absurdly expensive and actually ruin the game",3,23,1.8.4
Krissy Quevedo,"Really addicting, fun to play. Haven't noticed any glitches. The money you get for watching ads make them less painful to the flow of gameplay. It's really fun to watch the hotel progress as you earn more.",5,23,1.9.9

However whenever you get into the game you'll understand why I like this game. You pay rent or your hotel will I mean will go bankrupt.

So my final thing I say is Hi world.",5,23,1.2.0
A Google user,"Fun game. The con is that the event hotel would be more fun if it earned money like the other hotels when idle.

It would come in handy during the event hotel.",4,23,1.6.0
Vignesh Selva Kannan,"This game was really fun, still plying. I don't see any bugs compare to other codigames.

They even don't have affordable starter back here like other codigames.

Unfair Valor,"This game is really fun, well made, and surprisingly addicting. I reccomend playing it if you like taking your time to make very profitable businesses without needing to buy in app purchases. Two notes for the developers. 1. When you click on a room and then try to click off, there can be a bug where you don't, so maybe add an ""x"" in the top right to close out of the room upgrade menu. 2. Having more than four guests can sometimes cause the game to not add profits for additional guest's staying.",4,22,1.7.1

Taylor Munroe,"Very well programmed, planned, and executed. It's an impressive game. I also like that even though they ask for money it's not necessary to actually spend any to rank up and complete missions. Just takes a bit longer. I knocked a star off because the video ads are all 30 seconds or more and that's a lot for fake digital currency (you can watch an ad every minute or two so they add up).

Astermos-66,"The game is great. But I think there should be a little bit more details especially the NPCS.

A Google user,"Devs made prices extremely high to upgrade and buy new things like bar and upgrade generator to lvl 2. This is a crippled turtle with one leg in terms of advancing. You make very little money, even offline. Basically forcing you to spend real money. Game massively tailored for PTW. They need to redo the entire money making and upgrading for this game to even be playable. Unistalled",1,20,1.0
A Google user,"I want to love this game. But any game that makes you watch an ad for TEN MINUTES of double profits is ridiculous. Oh, don't like ads? It's cool just pay ELEVEN dollars. The game is only four levels, so you're paying that for maybe a weeks worth of gameplay. It's insane how greedy these developers are. The market is saturated with tons of games like this. Pick a different one",1,20,1.2.1
Fiona Hartzuiker,"I would have given 4 stars ( one star off because it seems to be a long time between new hotels and can become boring). I really like that you don't need to watch all the ads, one off purchase for that, and that any purchases are all one offs and constant subscriptions but since the last update I have been unable to purchase VIP packs for the latest event hotel so I will be unable to get the 3 star manager like I usually do. Please fix.",1,20,1.8.2
Emily Slade,"Great game, haven't completely as yet. The only problem is the timing for customers/guests is off, the beach bar opens at 12am but the customers come and look at it at 11 and the bar attending is on the way and they leave back to their room and once it hits 12 the go to the restaurant. Same with the customer leave time some nights the hotel is empty because people check out people come to check in but no staff. Also i believe you should add customers to use others facilities like ski, spa ticket",3,20,1.8.4
Kelsey B,"I got really into it and played pretty much non stop the whole day. But...then I got all the upgrades for the first hotel and figured out that your 'profits' won't transfer to other hotels. I guess now I'm done with the game, because what's the point of playing if you get all the upgrades but then have nothing left to spend the profits on? It would be a better game if the profits were collective in my opinion.",3,20,1.7.3
Donna Andrews,It's a good game. The things that let it down are: 1. The restaurant can never have enough staff to service the number of tables and customers 2. Customers will go to facilities that are closed. No one would so that. 3. Glitches. Staff don't work for the full time they are paid for. Customers get stuck and take up spaces in facilities. Housekeepers will not clean all rooms even through there is enough staff and time.,4,20,1.9.7
Day mon,I hope there is a global leaderboard for the most wealthiest player. Also put some challenging AI that could make this game alot interesting like the employee have emotions like a stress that could affect their performance due to intense workplace. Like busy day __,5,20,1.9.95
A Google user,"I love this game, isn't money grabbing at all. I dont have to wait hours for upgrades! I love it so much I would actually pay for it. No problem with the ads as they're options and give you rewards. I was super disappointed with the graphics on the Santa hotel, as all the beds and rooms look the same as the hotel before and it doesn't fit in with the theme, plus the ""climate control"" was air conditioning... in a snowy area? It just didn't make sense, I hope the next hotel at least makes sense",4,19,1.3.0
Benjamin Chambers,"Extremely aggressive monetization and very buggy. If you want more than 2 hours idle time you have to pay over $10. Fine, I thought, I'll see if I like it first. But sometime when you come back you don't get any idle results at all, as if no time has passed. It's often enough that I've taken to force closing it every time I leave the app. Also, I will frequently watch ads and not get the rewards for them.",1,19,1.7.1
A Google user,"The biggest drawback to this game is the speed at which you earn money - it's abysmal. I played almost an hour and time went by painfully slow with very little money coming in. The only way to progress in a reasonable time frame is to watch videos constantly for more cash and to instantly start the next day. It's painful having to watch so many videos. Once you get the ""no ads"" package the game becomes enjoyable. If you want to enjoy the game, you'll need to spend the $10 USD for that pack.",3,19,1.2.0
Corey Bird,"Ads hang and crash the game all the time, and this is the only way to make money (you'll spend more time watching ads than playing the game BTW). Makes for a terrible experience. When the game crashes, you have to restart progress and that is also very frustrating. For example, if all your hotel rooms are booked when the game crashes, when you start the game again, a bunch of rooms are empty, and you lose money because your operating expenses are the same. Game had potential. Ruined by buggy ads",1,19,1.7.1
A Google user,"I could not be more happy with this game! It is super addicting, a wonderful time passer! You also do not have to spend real money in order to progress, there are optional upgrades you can buy with real money (which are totally worth it) but you can play without these upgrades. 5 stars without a doubt, best hotel game out there.",5,19,1.6.0
A Google user,There is some major glitches. Rm 102 is always dirty. The suite has 2 different levels of end tables and the prices fluctuate with each log in. At one point i was making 102k hour then I logged out and back in and I was making 56k hour. There are several other things wrong as well. Please fix. Thank you. Love this game. So glad that a new level came out. Can't wait until it's fixed completely!!,3,19,1.4.0
Robin Arnett,"I got past the tutorial and it is way more dialed down with the unnecessary conversations that stop the flow of the game. I absolutely love this game! It's a great Tycoon game and I spent money to get rid of the ads and get 2x profits all the time. I never buy anything in mobile games, but this one is an exception. 5/5 Fantastic Game",5,19,1.9.93
A Google user,"I would rate 5 stars but their is a huge problem. So basically, you complete a hotel 100% and you go to the next hotel, but then you find out that you can't carry ANY money from your old hotel to your new hotel. So you're left ALMOST BROKE while your other hotel just sitting their raking in the dough. And to top it off, the hotels stuff become more and more expensive as you play. PLEASE fix this issue because I'm not watching a million ads just for a few upgrades and this issue made me ragequit",2,19,1.3.1
Karan Parekh,The game is awesome and I love to have it as a pastime. Although I would say that a good way to have endgame content would be to add a longer event that runs for a month or so. After finishing the final hotel it feels meaningless to play for an event that only runs for a few days.,5,19,1.9.91
A Google user,"The concept is good, but the game feels unfinished. There's no missions for the second hotel, you can't transfer income from the first to the second so there's no point to the first hotel once you've passed it, and sometimes the game mechanics feel a bit unbalanced.",2,19,0.3.1
A Google user,"This is not intended to be a free game. You essentially need to watch an ad to accomplish most tasks. In 30 minutes of playing the game you will spend 15 watching ads. And the game is very demanding and if you spend time away from it, you can essentially lose money if things are not running smoothly. Cool concept but not for me.",2,19,1.1.1
Stefan Brad,"This game is pretty good. I personally like managing games and this one is the one that i will remember. I like that you can have more hotels, that each hotel has it's own special upgrades and that once you watch a few ads to get some money for upgrades you will keep wining more money! Great game.",5,19,1.8.4
Ebenezer Lyall,I decided to give this game a try because I loved Theme Park Tycoon but due to some reasons I am giving it 3 star rating. The ads displayed often do no give rewards. They are being watched for no use and it's even more irritating when the rewrds are not provided. This needs to be fixed so the reward can be provided as promised before watching the ad.,3,19,1.8.4
Jorin Hagen,"I would have given this game an instant five stars if it weren't for the steep price tags for some of these in-game offers. The gameplay and music is enjoyable; repetitive, but enjoyable nonetheless. Though, I do wish they add new permanent hotels to work on; the event hotels are just way too short for the constant payment to get them done.",4,19,2.0
Jade Charman,Its a great game but i've completed all the hotels...please add more Also i think a time speed up function while online could be fun... Also the purchase function needs fixing...on a couple of occations i have purchased things and its charged me but not added the purchased items to the game and its not always worth the 3-5 day process to get it refunded,4,19,1.9.93
Ben Jackson,"This game is good. I like the way that you can still travel to old islands dislike the other games, BUT when you get to the 2nd hotel, it gets extreme. Please make the game easier. Ty!",5,19,1.9.93
Rin Youzura,"It's fun I think, It's feel like you really manage a hotel with the money you got and such. But I think the event is kinda unfair.. Because no matter how hard you try, you won't get a star in the hotel, you really have to buy the VIP package to get a star in the event and it's suck. Well, if you're looking for a game to kill your time, maybe this one is good for you tho. Hope the review helps.",4,19,1.9.9
JacQuisha Evans,"I love the game but the last update took a lot of things I have already bought in the game ( rooms, suites, casino, pool, spa, nightclub, archery) I'm in the Little Camelot Hotel and majority everything is back at square one.",4,19,1.9.9
Angel Stanley,So far love this game. But so far there is only 5 hotels. So when is there going to be a update to add new hotels? Been waiting a year. And the weekly hotel that you do where you have to pay to even finish it don't count. And I have money invested in this game. Been nothing.,5,19,1.9.95
Bojan Petrovic,"My original review was 5 stars. It was enjoying this game until my purchase has been deleted. I payed with real money and played and then suddenly, my purchase didn't exist any more. Plus my progress was deleted and I was using only one device for this game. I am gone and will never ever install or play any codigames.",1,19,1.9.9
Stephanie Wilson,Finally! An idle mobile tycoon game that's more than mass clicking! Greatly enjoying it so far! I hope there are endless levels!,5,19,1.7.2
A Google user,"A lot of fun, I enjoy games that build up. Though it would be a lot more convenient to be able to have all the money from the hotels in one ""account"" to use since it just goes to waste once everything is leveled. Plus it would add a fun management angle with needing to keep a level of money always to pay staff across the different hotels. But I am really enjoying it, I hope more hotels are added!",4,18,1.3.1
A Google user,"Please add more hotels soon! I bought the ""remove ads"" feature, which has made the gameplay go a lot faster and it got rid of having to watch all those annoying ads. It made it easier to build up the hotels and within a week, I've completed all 3 hotels. I would have thought it was a waste if I didnt see that this game came out this month. Please add more hotels soon! :)",4,18,1.1.1
A Google user,"If you read the reviews, for the most part they are spot on. Graphics are great. It's a time eater. There are a lot of ads but I find that with most games. If you pay for the ad removal, the game progresses smoothly. I do worry about finishing the 5th hotel as it seems people catch up to developers with no where to go above that. My concern with these slow developed games is it will stop working upon update or they change the pay features and make it more difficult to achieve progression.",5,18,1.3.1
A Google user,"Very good when you want to kill time. Definitely like the art and design. Only issue I have is I purchased the benefits without watching ads. I start the game after not playing for awhile, the option to double your profit is there but when I tap it and hit claim I only get the normal amount of money shown. Worse off, if you don't tap the double profit and just claim the money, you don't get anything. Unacceptable if Im paying for the upgrade and not getting it. Please help, 5 stars otherwise.",3,18,1.2.0
A Google user,Game is a nice time killer but gets pointless. After you 5 star a hotel it pretty much dies cause you can't use the money it generates. $10 is kinda expensive to skip ads with the fact I just mentioned. Unless they add more hotels or give you more features the game is pointless after you max all of then out. I'm on the second hotel now and everything is hella expensive. Guess that's to stop you from progressing too fast so they can keep getting the ad revenue. And now the ads wont work.,3,18,1.2.1
A Google user,"I don't know if its only me, but I can't seem to get past the initial quest. I don't have engouh money, and I have only 3 staff, and upgraded what the quest told me to upgrade. Been everytime I go into the game, I only get negative numbers. So I dunno, I really, really love this types of games, and i think this has alot of potential, but so far for me, it's just so slow, (hate nighttime), need to use money or watch ads all the time.",1,18,1.1.1
A Google user,"This is a great game and I could spend ages playing this. However, lots of minor bugs, some of which were fixed in the update this morning. However the update has now broken the AI as hotel guests now try and go to ski or the spa late at night, get angry as it is closed and then leave. So hotel is only at 50% full every single night (with a 5 star fully upgraded hotel). I would love more hotels as well as there are only 2 currently. Once you complete the second one there is nothing else to do.",4,18,1.0
Benjamin Zammit,This game is definitely my favourite of CODI games as the graphics are great and the economy system actually is realistic. But the guests pathfinding is horrible. Why do I have guests wandering around the pool at 10 pm instead of at the nightclub? It's causing me to lose money for no reason. The guests shouldn't be path finding to a closed facility.,4,18,2.4
Scythe H,"Where most idle games give you lots of stuff and progress fast at first then come to a crawl, this is one of the slowest idle games I've played. It was kinda cool to build up my hotel slowly over time rather than all at once, but as soon as I moved to the second hotel to start from 0, I had no desire to do it again.. it's just too slow to progress",3,18,1.7.1
Hugo Rabe,"Love this game so much, but there are plenty of little things that could be improved. One particular thing that has bothered me is the hours that services are open. It make more sense to me to be able to leave them open all day. Another idea is the ability to use income from completed hotels to improve new ones. A gift or transfer feature would work well",4,18,1.8.4
Altafadhil Fernandavito,"I gave 3 starts just because the ads problem. Why is the ad videos only working at the first time you play this game? A few hours later I play this game, and the ad videos just keep spinning and can't be played, sometimes the taxi one just won't work by watching one video, I had to watch it twice to make it works.",3,18,1.9.7
A Google user,"F me is this game is balanced around watching ads. The idea of the game is fun and good.... but man, the moment where you earn 100x more (not even exagurated) by watching ads rather then playing the game is just downright sad. I don't mind paying money for a good experience of a game. But if I were to pay the whopping 12 bucks to remove ads, I would just make it worse as I won't have a reason to skip the ad money anymore. I literally earn the money of 30 minutes with one ad.",1,18,1.2.0
Cynthia Elliott (Memento Mori),"Love it Amazing game. The only suggestion i have is to allow the money earned at one hotel to be available to the other hotels. That is the only reason i give 4 stars. Addicting game and great game play. But one of my hotels racks up tons of money that is pretty much useless, i would like to use some of that money for my other hotels.",4,18,1.7.1
Jarrod Patton,"I like the game, some of the hotels are really simple to get through and the events are fun. Keep those up! I do wish I could control the service hours of all services. Too many times I watch money leave because they are 30 min late or early. Please give us the ability to control the hours or adjust the hours for longer services. No bar should close at 12am!!",4,18,1.9.8
Delores Brown,Im having the same issue. I cant even skip night time on the game anymore because the button to show the ad wont load. Im not playing this game anymore until its fixed because I want the x2 profits and skip night time. Update: took a star away because the same problem with the ads is happening again. Will uninstall if this continues. Lost out on double profit overnight because ads wont load again smh,2,18,1.9.8
EA M.,"Update: deleting the game after not getting my earnings when entering the game for the 3rd time. Waist of my time... It could be fun. I passed level one and realized that you don't take the money you worked hard making w you and the money you collect in level 1 does not continue to go in your bank for other levels. I play other tycoons that take the money with them from level to level, much more fun to play. I will play this second level to give it a fair shot, but kinda bored.",1,18,1.8.4
G S,Great game no purchases necessary unless you want it add free (small one time purchase which makes it more easy to play quickly). Additional purchases can make game play faster but I have enjoyed playing gradually. Only complaint is that you cannot update a whole room at once- which for those of us who like to play methodically would make finishing a level easier. It is a but tedious to update each sink and each bed up multiple levels. Please include an update all for each room in next upgrade!,5,18,1.8.4
Kuda Kwashe,"Gameplay isn't very fun thanks to the lagging and one of my housekeepers always getting stuck in a hotel room. The persistent internet connection requirement sucks. I do, however, appreciate that ads are available to make money, unlike some other money grubbing apps that make it impossible for one to progress without paying real money.",3,18,1.8.4
Carol Gaigneur,"Good concept but it would be nice if the money from the other hotels carried on to the next one that you unlock. Otherwise you can collect all of this money and when you cannot upgrade anything anymore..it feels like a waste. Please consider doing this, and also there should be an option to buy General Managers with the gold diamonds that are earned, investing real money for a GM for each hotel is NOT ideal.",3,18,1.8.3
August Invercargill,"I kinda like this simulation game. Downside is that profits are way too low. And you need an investor everytime, in which requires for you to watch ads that are 30 seconds long. I want a game where I could enjoy playing and not getting pissed watching nonsense ads of other games which I'm not going to download anyway.",2,18,1.9.9
Carmen Caraballo,"I love this game. I can seriously play it for hours if I'm left alone. However, I'm only rating it two stars because the things are getting too expensive and the ads to get extra cash isn't working. Fix this glitch then and only then will I change my rating.",2,18,1.9.8
A Google user,"I can't in good conscience recommend this game and there is one big glaring reason why. One of the main components of an idle game is the ability to gain resources while you aren't playing. This game allows you to do so, but only after buying the ability with real money.

Carson___ch_ X,"This game is really fun!!! I love pretty much all your games. On thing about this that I don't like is, I just started today, I don't get a lot of money but everything is really expensive so I have to wait a long time before I can buy anything. Also I love the fact that I can watch ads to get money! If that wasn't there then it would be really hard to buy stuff. Hopefully you can put more updates! It is amazing and a really good time killer! Tysm for making this game!!!! __",5,18,1.7.2
Marie-Louise De Cort,"I have loved this game but today the game doesn't want to load. I have uninstall (which probably means I have lost all my data and I was on the last hotel) then re-installed it. Still, it loads but stays on the loading screen. The developer xame back to me and fix the problem. I was very impressed. I am so happy to be able to carry on with this game. I hope they will soon get another similar game",5,18,1.8.4
A Google user,It's a nice idle game. Wish there was a vacant sign guests could stop coming when there are no rooms left.. but really love this game. When I wrote this review I was in the second hotel and I was really enjoying it. The 3rd hotel is awesome. Then I got to the last hotel and now I'm upset. I worked really hard to get there and it's the first hotel with more rooms. Nothing extra like the beach hotel where you have scuba diving and a hotel pool. Still the first hotel just barely themed.,3,18,1.2.1
Twins Power,"Edit: They already fixed the login Google Play issue. Thank you so much! Really like this game since the trailer seem really promising, and the graphics is really good. Keep the game up, by maybe building more hotels with different variant.",5,18,1.9.93
Julius Allen,I love the game its great how you only get ads if you choose to have i mean of course your gonna have ads but most of them give rewards after. I have downloaded this game in the past and you dont get progress fast and nor do you get it slow its more of how you play the game. Honestly i recommend this game just because of how fun it is and how much stuff you get to do. Good job Codigames and keep doing what your doing.,5,18,1.8.4
Chris Kyng,Pay to play (at least $100 game) To get to the next level you have to buy EVERY item on that hotel floor. This includes the special gem items. Theres ways to earn gems....just never enough to progress to the next level. So you have to buy at $10-$20 a pop to have enough gems to progress. It says free but the truth is this game costs over $100 to fully play by level 4 (and that's just the normal levels)... Youre better off buying a damn Xbox or Playstation. Also the developers don't respond.,3,18,1.8.3
Prasenjit Biswas,"Liked it but few problems, in the beginning you are responsible for a hotel when you get 5* for it then it starts making enough money which you cannot rotate in other branches which gets unlocked and due to that you are stuck at that level unless you invest your real money. Fix this as the owner will bear the responsibility of all hotels so using the unused money lying there else it's wasted",5,18,1.9.8
A Google user,"It's a good game, but it costs a lot to remove the ads & have other features. To remove ads, you need to pay $10.99. To double your VIP rewards (not worth it), it's $5.99 while another feature is $10.99. I was tempted to remove the ads until I only saw four hotels. I think it did a good job of creating new features (ski area, bar, restaurant, scuba, etc.), but it has potential to be more. It's definitely a battery drainer, & people get stuck in the spa causing me to restart and lose guests.",3,17,1.2.1
A Google user,"I really like the game but...Extras (ie. hiring a manager) are seriously over-priced. After paying said extortionate price for an extra, I would not expect the game to then end after completing 4 levels. I was considering raising this issue with support or requesting a refund, but then after around a month of not being able to play because I had finished the game, another level was added. Which I then finished in a couple of days. Just add more levels at a quicker rate so we can continue playing",2,17,1.3.1
A Google user,"Very good game. Spend many hours with this game and have a lot of good times. The game progressive is good, doesn't take extremely long to achieve something.

Kyla Cranston,"This was fun for a short time, but now ads won't load. It offers options like watch an ad for 2x the away profit or to increase earnings by 2 for ten minutes, but there are no ads available. The investors no longer show up either, presumably due to no ads. This makes it much more boring and I likely won't play much now unless it gets fixed.",2,17,2.5.1
Amanda Buehner,I am really disappointed as I'm one to not pay for things in games so I rely on the adds and they are not working. There is no way to complete the bonus event without the adds on constantly for 2x profits. Its 50/50 if I log in and it allows me to watch the adds. If your willing to spend money then this game is for you. If you just want a challenge and not spend money this game sucks right now.,2,17,1.9.7
Jason Thomas,Remove Idle. Something about this game hooked me. Satisfying progression and curiosity. Ads or not. I did levels watching ads Spent 10 bucks. I hope the developers continue to expand this game. More levels. Using that creativity. The Turkish belly dance! Great Sim game!! But it needs more levels as I've finished the game.,5,17,1.8.4
A Google user,"Really like this game! The artwork is the main draw for me, very cute. love the little customers walking around and the items around the hotel. I happily spend the one off $17 AUD fee to remove the ads and have access to all the feature. Love it when games offer that option rather than continue to gouge their customers for $1000's in microtransact. To all these people complaining about the cost, er...have you never bought a game from steam ? P.S love the Mad Men ref. Keep up the good work guys!",5,17,1.4.4
Theopposedgamer,"I love the game obsessed lots of play time but still entertaining, I've spent 20 bucks on the game but the last time I got something, it was the pack for the event where some customers spend 50 percent more and I get a bonus profit suite with promised 4000 cash a day. I didn't get it and I got charged for it. I want a refund or something of better value in game since I kinda got screwed. Otherwise love the game definitely worth the download maybe not in app purchases",4,17,1.9.95
Emilio Ortiz,"i was really enjoying this game until i lost a star on the second hotel whilst working on the third hotel for no reason that i could figure out despite over an hour of trying and therefore was unable to advance. plus too many ads and it's definitely a play to win sort of game. as a result of all of this, i was forced to uninstall as i could get no further in the game. this really bums me out as i was very much enjoying this game up to this point. seems i'm not the only one with these problems.",1,17,1.7.2
Renzo Pingul,"This is the best idle game you have made so far. I like how it is not just a one-sided game wherein you always move forward. This game will make your progress harder if not taken care of. This tests your strategy skills on which to upgrade first, and I'm a fan of such gameplays. But I won't be giving 5 stars because I cannot contact the app developer for I have something to ask.",4,17,1.7.1
V.J. Niles,This game is ok could be much better. You should allow people not getting a room to use the restaurant or bar as a way to gain more revenue. Once you finish a hotel there nothing more until an event which are hard to get anywhere with in 3 days with only 50k to start. Make it a bit more interesting and I'm not buying the same vip package for every event adjust that model. Can you expand the events or hotels? We should be able to adjust costs or hours of operations.,2,17,2.4
Athen DellaRatta,"It's an amazing game but the new Codi Resort is not loading for me and it gets stuck in an endless loading cycle.

Ryan Griffiths,"I love the business owning concept as very few games are designed to make it feel like real life, but when it comes to the events, it's clearly just an extra way to get people to spend more money on something you won't be able to keep for the next event. That said, if you don't buy the presidential suite pack for the event, you'll be very hard pressed to get 2 of the 3 stars, and it ruins the appeal of the game. Putting very hard effort into something with little reward will make people quit.",3,16,1.7.2
A Google user,Great game over all. Only issue I have is that they seem to be way too heavy on advertising. Most games usually offer 2 hours of 2x income for watching an advertisement. This game only gives you 10 minutes. I would happily pay to have double income if the price was reasonable. They ask way too much. I can see the exorbitant amount of adverts getting old after a week and I'll eventually stop playing.,3,16,1.3.1
Louise Ingleton,Was enjoying this game. However ads stopped working so I uninstalled and reinstalled (as I'd done a couple of times before) and it bombed me back to the start! Game play is very slow without watching ads so if the ads keep hanging it's not worth playing... EDIT found out why I lost progress. I was logged into a different Gmail account so even though I was still logged into the correct Google play account it lost progress! Still a pain that ads stop working and I have to reinstall frequently,4,16,2.6.1
A Google user,Game idea is pretty good...I like it. But you can't always be online and you lose money when your hotel is closed. No real grinding opportunities here. you have to pay for hiring a manager. Also there should be some good options for maxed out player to use their wealth on something or contesting with other players in some way. BOTTOM line it shouldn't have to be pay to win,3,16,1.3.0
Rana Hazem,"The game is cool, i don't really mind watching some short ads to gain money and all BUT one thing I hate is the fact that you can't transfer money from 1 hotel to the other. I mean, what is even the point of earning a great amount of money if I won't be able to use it after the hotel is upgraded to 5 stars? It's frustrating to have to start all over again in each new hotel and it seems pointless.",2,16,1.7.1
K S,Having serious issues with videos and rewards. Sometimes clicking a video doesn't do anything at all. Sometimes the video closes prematurely and no reward is given. It's making it frustrating to do the event hotel when I can't get the 2x profit bonus. Or the VIP guests either. Basically any video rewards aren't working for me.,1,16,1.7.2
Steve Petrick,"I've really been enjoying this game, but it is a shameless money guzzler. I know that's par for the course on these kind of games, but they charge money for an upgrade pack for EVERY EVENT THEY HAVE! I spent $10.99 on an upgrade for an event, thinking it would be there when the next event started, but now it wants me to buy another one for this event. Extremely disappointing. I'm not sure if I'll be continuing to play this game anymore.",3,16,1.7.1
Shan H,This game can be fun but it does try to push you to spending real money and it is VERY expensive. Its clear the challenge to get a manager is just a gimmick to get you to spend real money because the goal and cost of everything is extortionate but don't worry they have convenient booster packs you can buy to help progress. Gameplay is mainly watching ads. Your money doesn't transfer between hotels and you can only get offline profits for one hour. All about money.,2,16,1.8.4
Abhishek Vishukarma,"It would be very good if you guys added some more minigames or increase our control of the hotels. And sometimes something get hidden by other things, so it would be awesome if you made this 360angle view, i mean it's boring to just zoom in and zoom out. Hoping you guys will show your magic by Improving this game as soon as possible or before i get bored. And one more maybe you guys should make our pocket of all hotels one because hotels we fully upgraded become useless after that. Thank You _",3,16,1.8.4
A Google user,"Great game. But once you have completed a hotel and gone to the next, the fact you can't use the old hotels money is pointless. There's nothing left for me to upgrade in the first hotel yet moneybis racking up. Other hotel is idle. Gets boring after a whole because you go so far just to start at the beginning again. Change this please.",2,16,1.6.0
Alireza Farzaneh,"It's a long game if you want to finish it without buying items or watching ads. It took me a year and a half to finish it. In the last hotels, it gets laggy while moving around the hotel. But when I'm upgrading room's stuff, it freezes for a second or two.",2,16,1.9.9
A Google user,This game can be fun. There are plenty of issues. For one the VIP cash videos dont always work. The cash flow could be improved some. It feels like a very big grind to get anything improved. Especially when you get a new hotel. You will lose a few staff pretty quickly because you arent generating enough money. Hopefully you guys fix the issues soon or at least keep this game updated frequently.,4,16,1.1.1
A Google user,"The game itself is pretty entertaining and engaging. Lots to do and explore, but also a lot of decisions that will affect the bottom line. The only 3 issues that I have is: 1 Limited number of people you can hire for specific jobs. Which in turn you have to pay attention to P/U the slack. 2 Kitchen staff take break right during peak hrs. And maids follow straight lines that sometimes waste alot of valuable time. 3 Now that I reached my final Hotel there's nothing to do.",4,16,1.3.1
Christy,"I love the game but once I reached the third hotel, any time I click on the investor to watch the ads for more money, either nothing happens when i click watch ad or I watch a few seconds of the ad and nothing still happens. Please fix.",3,16,1.9.95
A Google user,I like the game very interactive but the challenges i have completed but i haven't recieved the rewards therefore I cannot progress in the game.

A Google user,"I love this game so far! My only problem is that sometimes the Dancing King and/or taxi offering glitch. I click on them to watch the ad but it just closes out and doesn't give me the ad or the money. Also I have a concern about completed 5 star hotels. I'm asking for a way to incorporate the previous hotel's savings into the current one. This is because right now I have The Codinential completed, and no way to spend the money. The money just keeps piling up and I have nowhere to spend it. Thank",4,15,1.2.0
Grace Bee,"A truly enjoyable game, but if played for more than 15-30min the ads stop playing and you don't get any of the perks (instant sunrise, investor, travel agency). I've tried closing the app and reopening as well as restarting my phone, but that either only fixes the problem for a few minutes or doesn't fix it at all. Once a hotel is somewhat established these perks aren't as important, but in the beginning the speed at which you make money is negligible and it quickly gets boring.",3,15,1.7.1
A Google user,"I love this game. It's simple and fun to use. It has its normal challenges for these types of games but my #1 complaint is once you complete one hotel and move on to the next, you can't use ANY of the money you make from your previous hotels to use on the next one. So it takes about a week of consistently playing and constantly watching ads to make any progress at the beginning of building your hotel. Can the developers tell me why?",4,15,1.2.0
A Google user,"I was enjoying this game for a little bit until the ads. You HAVE to click on the ads to even get anywhere in this game and for the ads that are supposed to give you a ""reward"" they never do!

Aaron Hauth,"The queues are too short on larger hotels and the pathings are bad, and the ads are a lot, but once you get past all that, the games decent and the art is nice ///// Later edit: the game is really boring after you get to the 3-5 star range, especially for the later levels. Hell, all I do at that point in the game is boot up the app, watch the ad to double my offline income, and then close the app. Repeat that process every two hours until you get enough money for those last expensive items.",1,15,1.8.4
A Google user,"Game is addictive but many times even after I click on Watch video which comes while the dancing king appears, the video still don't play at all.

Charissa de Waardt,I've played a lot of your games and all of them have ad issues. This one is particularly bad. You can watch 1 ad and then you'll have to close the game completely if you'd like to watch another. When you're trying to get the 2x bonus and have to restart the game for every ad you also lose time. Sometimes when there are like 5 minutes left of the bonus the game will cancel those 5 minutes when you restart the game. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun but this ad issue makes playing it tiring,3,15,1.9.7
khushi arora,"The game and app is fun. Just a lot of bugs. Im unable to play an ad after I've played it once. It requires me to restart the game and am unable to just continue on while playing and watch and ad in between while my hotel thrives. Eveeytime u close the game to rest the ad, the game loses its progress. Its quite annoying and the bug needs urgent fixing.",2,15,1.9.91
Mike Taylor,"Really enjoyed this game, the ads placement is really well done, you can play the whole game and never watch ad but progress will be slow. Had to drop a star, been over two months since a new hotel and theres no reply value on the others. You collect cash you cant spend and do event hotels for bonuses that you cant use as all hotels completed with no option to restart them. To sum up. 5* game when you first start but once completed theres nothing left to do so 3 *",3,15,1.7.2
Sayantani Dutta,So the game is great and I have understood it has a lot of playability factor. But suddenly the advertisements stopped after the first 2 hours. So I can't understand if this is a glitch or a cap since it is very difficult to move forward without the advertisements. Could you please address!!!,4,15,2.3.2
Tiffany Davenport,"To be honest, the ads made the game look boring. The only reason why I downloaded it was because I was bored with my other games, and the ads for this game popped up dozens of times. But it IS a fun game. I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I do (or at all). It keeps my interest and keeps me coming back the next day. I don't really have much to complain about. Once you find a good strategy, the game is real enjoyable! But sometimes when you watch an ad, you don't get the reward.",4,15,1.7.1
A Google user,"I love how this game is based off the money you have, theres no labeled level you need to be in to be able to do a certain thing. One thing I wished they could change is the money transfer. I currently am maxed out of upgrades with my first hotel and now I'm making so much money but I cannot spend it, while my second hotel is in so much debt. It would be really neat if my money from my 1st hotel can also be of help to all of my hotels.",4,15,1.2.0
A Google user,"Most expensive in game microtransactions I've ever seen in a game. Ever! The money earned in game to money earned watching ads ratio favours the ads. If you want a game where you watch the same adverts of the same equally greedy microtransactions heavy games, this is the game for you. Don't let the charm of this game fool you. It's quite shallow once you get past the first hotel.",2,15,1.2.0
Tammy Fleming,"This game is relaxing and a lot of fun! It's exciting to manage & upgrade different hotels! I wish there was a way to share proceeds from completed hotels with other hotels you are currently upgrading. Otherwise, what's the point of completed hotels continuing to earning millions when theres nothing else you can do with the proceeds __...the ONLY reason it didnt get 5 stars.__ *Today game is throwing error 4 code when opened and cannot be played*",4,15,1.8.3

Courtney Murphy,"The game needs more hotels I have beat all the hotel levels and all that exists are the events that you have to pay for to get the full experience of the event, where you win character's that could potentially help you in the hotels that have already been beaten or finished.

Rico Paat,"The game should be renamed ""watching ads tycoon"" because the time spent in the game, literally 90% is for watching ads and the rest for actually playing the game.

A Google user,"A fun time killer. Ads are completely optional, you dont have to watch any if you dont want too, and you still progress at a good pace without them. The main thing that I find kinda offputting, is once you upgrade everything in a hotel, all it does is just make money for you. Theres nothing more to do. You cant even send profits from one hotel to another. Great game overall.",5,14,1.3.1
Jessica Jablonski,"I love this game. I like the themes around each hotel. The developers have given a lot of thought to detail which I like in a game. I would love to see an ""upgrade all"" button especially when I know I have enough funds to upgrade the entire room. Also my game just started shutting off after the update so that's a little frustrating.",5,14,1.8.3
Tristina Tracy,"Love the game. Very addictive and fun. The only thing, in my opinioun, that could be added to make the game more fun would be a money transfer system for different hotels. Not only would it make the other hotels slightly easyer, it would also remove the annoyance of so much useless cash pileing up as well. Other than that, best idle game I've ever played!!!!!!!",5,14,1.7.1
A Google user,"The game itself doesn't need any input from you other than upgrading things as much as you can, which quickly takes a lot longer unless your spend money or watch a lot of ads. All in all there's only 4 hotels, so in the space of a few weeks you can finish the games by popping on to double your bonus every two hours, upgrading, and repeating that. If you wanted to actually watch the game, you can, but there's little to nothing in the way of interaction.",2,14,1.2.0
A Google user,"It is a fun game, but content is limited. Also, I don't understand why we can't utilise the money made from completed hotels to fund the new ones. I would rather things be a bit more expensive in the following hotels rather than just have the money collecting and being useless. It also seems that you can't get 5 stars without using in game currency. Again, it would be a good opportunity to give the options of a higher price OR gems. Good game, but definitely room for improvement.",3,14,1.2.1

Roozie F,Unplayable!!! Really enjoyed this game for awhile as you have to take time can't just fly through it but it has become unplayable as you have to use adds to progress in the game you can play for a little bit then adds won't load at this point I just delete the game because it's not worth it to me to keep letting them know anyways hopefully yall have better luck,2,14,2.0
A Google user,Love this game! I've already completed all the levels. It's beautifully designed and although earning income is a little slow at first it all feels very rewarding! UPDATE: After yesterdays update the quests work perfectly! I absolutely can't wait for more hotels to be added :) easily one of my favourite idle games that you guys have made! Thank you!,5,14,0.2.0
A Google user,This is a developer that listens to it's players. Codigames different idle games have always been fun but I've backed away from some of them because you spend an excessive amount of time watching videos to progress rather than enjoying the game. Now incorporating a feature where you can eliminate most videos for a price was an EXCELLENT idea. Players now have the option. $10.99 seems a bit much but developing games does cost money. Good job on this game!!,5,14,1.2.0
Joshua Kirby,"Overall a good 4 star game. Great quality and it has a rare feature; negative income. Most idle/clicker/tycoon games dont incorporate expenses into the mix. Also, Yahoo article ads are quality in the fact they never glitch out, unlike other types of ads other games have.",4,14,1.9.93
Samantha Stanford,I love this game! Its slow to start at first with a limited income but you get extra money from the dancing money man and from the parking lot/rooms. I havent played the event very much because its expensive and relies on you constantly playing it and the event seems p2w. I have bought the x2 modifier and it does help! You have to be a little thoughtful on what you spend your money on. I gave it 4 stars because of the event and the hounding of the paid managers. But this game is really fun!,4,14,1.8.3
A Google user,"It's a decent game, but nothing really out there for an idle tycoon. Definitly a cash grabber but, thems the breaks. Don't really have any complaints except for the fact that theres no way to tell why customers get angry. You just see a pulsing anger mark above them and you have to guess. Was it the resturant? The bar? Their hotel room? The cleaning service too slow? Theres no way to tell. If there was like, a customer reviews tab on the stats page that would make that easier. Just a suggestion.",4,14,1.1.1

Victor Vignjevic,"Great game, I used to play the Idle Prison Tycoon game and i found this one to be much more enjoyable overall.

A Google user,I LOVE this game. It's not a game that you can blow trough quickly unless you spend money. The only issue is that the ads doesn't load about 60%-75% of the time. And even then the failed ad load only works for night into day. I think that if the ad fails on your part that we should keep the reward. Overall a great game,3,12,1.1.1
A Google user,Fun! I am a hour in and having a blast. My only criticism is maybe lower the price on the ad removal service. I hate ads as much the next person but not for $11 of my hard earned dollars on top of needing to purchase managers to run the place while you are offline. I know it takes a lot to create this game but as a consumer I wouldn't pay that for 1 service.,5,12,1.1.1
Shavanti Hiles,I only gave it three stars because after the update or whenever the update was because my phone automatically updates. the game quit giving me coins when I watch a video so I don't know if it's a glitch and it also takes a very long time to load when I open up the app. But I'm not sure what the problem is I just hate I can't get the money that I earned for watching videos but the game is awesome I love this game no problems besides that. Would like to compensated if possible for missing coins.,3,12,1.7.1
Jem DLS,This idle game is perfect me! The upgrade for instant claims and skipping all ads bought by husband for me is really awesome. Great job for the app maker. Also want to ask if you could add some tips on how to minimoze losses.. I've got some bsr with word losses on it but couldn't find out why. Lol. Looking forward to more interactive upgrades from this app. Thanks a bunch,5,12,1.8.4
R S,"It is indeed a nice game. Thought the fact that you have to start from scratch to build each hotel and there is no option to transfer the money that you are still making in the previous hotels, is really frustrating and definitely makes people eventually delete the game from their devices. You only have the option to watch again and again ads to gain some cash to invest in each hotel separately. What is the use of the money that the previous finished hotels are still making? No clue.",2,12,1.8.4
A Google user,"Very nice game, I enjoy it a lot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of two details. First off the marketing expert ($5.49), general manager ($10.99), and no more adds($10.99) are separate to purchase. Can't there be a separate deal in which all three are put in a deal pack for only $20? Also, sometimes it feels like the game is very slow. Adding an option in the settings that makes the game double the speed or maybe even triple would be nice.",4,12,1.2.0
A Google user,"Very good game, only issue is once I completed my first hotel to 5 stars I was still earning money but I could no longer spend it, may be useful if you just have the one bank account for the entire game? Seeing as though the prices rise as you open more hotels anyway, would feel more realistic with that! Other than that, the only mobile game I've continued to play with out becoming bored!",5,12,1.7.1
Tylor Holmes,"Outstanding. I mean, if you buy no more ads and the 2x unlimited its pretty much a time killer. I love it. Yeah you may spend money to get somewheres but they use it to bring us more of these games. I played quite a few of their games and still enjoy it. Would like a way to make money quicker as its taken 3 days to pass the 1st hotel but other than that i love it",4,12,1.8.3
A Google user,It's a good game with lots to do. But you got greedy trying to charge a stupid amount of money to have double profits and the ads and stuff. On top of that for watching a 30 second ad you only get ten minutes double up time. You've done good with other games and your going to get greedy now and ruin it? Should be 30 mins for an ad as before with others and stop trying to extort players. $15 is greedy,2,12,1.1.1
Rogue Elixir,"Would be 5 stars but with it being so slow in the beginning and me having a feeling there isn't much to do after you 5 star everything, only 4 stars. Great time killer. Good idle game. Just need more to do to keep up looking forward to what's next that we don't have to wait for unless its a progression level.",4,12,1.8.4
A Google user,"This is one of my favorite games to play! It's quite relaxing on stressful days, and for me at least, buying the no ad option was worth it. I do have a question about the events though, if you buy the VIP pack for the event, does it carry into the other events? Since I have fully upgraded everything I have, the events are all that's left. If the VIP doesn't carry, I would have to buy it every time I did a new event, and that's just not worth it.",5,12,1.4.2
A Google user,"Beat the game in about two-three weeks. Loved it, was thoroughly invested. Adored the different hotel themes and seeing how they grew as i upgraded things. But now I've paid $20 for a game I can't do anything with except sit and earn more money with nothing to spend it on??? Is there more content coming??",3,12,1.4.0
Sandeep Kumar,The game would have been lot better if we can use the profits made by our previous upgraded hotels on our current hotels.. I mean every time the new hotel is opened we have to start from scratch with no money.. All that hard work and time spend on the previous hotel is for nothing. That's really bad.,1,12,1.7.3
A Google user,I would give more stars because it is a good game but you spent more time watching ads to advance than actual gameplay. You can get rid of ads buy paying a small fortune GREEDY GAME MAKER. USE ALL THIS MONEY FROM ADS TO MAKE A BETTER GAME. There are way better games that don't even make you watch any ads check out !!!!! UTOPIA ORIGINS !!!!!,1,12,1.2.0
Hunny Humphrey,"Was doing hotel event I had everything built including arcade disco, I had one star and 15, 807, woke today no arcade built and not my star and only 7, odd in total earnings, not the first time it's done this, fix the game as I'm on the last hotel and like the game, but for the events not keeping the money or the parts built,,,,,my last comment was removed,,, I've completed all hotels now there is nothing to do, more hotels please",1,12,1.7.2
Amelya Rosha,"Overall this is quite good and exciting game, but i think there is small weakness point in profit. I don't know if this game have this feature or not, but if this game have transfer profits among the hotels, it would be better. Thank you.",5,12,1.9.93
Rimii iii,I have been waiting so long for the ads to load and it automatically shuts off and wont give me the money of the ads. Why did I spend 10 minutes looking at a screen that says loading and not get anything from it? Give me back my coins,1,12,1.9.91
A carrot Named Sam,"Overall I really love this game! it takes stradigy and spending your money wisly. Its one of those harder idle games but a really run one. For now i will give it 4-stars becuase there are a few things they could fix. Sometimes when i watch a video it dosn't give me the rewards. And another is, it lags for ME way too much and i dont really enjoy the game when it does but overall I really enjoy the game!",4,11,1.7.1
A Google user,"This game is fun but you guys give us options to watch ads in exchange for the game's currency but it's a crapshoot if you get that money. Or sometimes when you click on the ad, it won't even play and almost immediately boots you out without getting paid the money. This is the only reason why I can't give it 5 stars, which is a shame because it's a fun....Update as of 3/1/20 - the situation, please fix, it's ruining the experience",3,11,1.3.1
gaming games,It's a great game I have only experienced a bug once it was after an add which there are ads but it froze for about 30 minutes but other than that AMAZING GAME!!,5,11,2.9
A Google user,"This is a great game! It's a great way to pass the time. However, I would give four stars if you could make it less about relying on watching ads to progress. Another VERY IMPORTANT thing to change for five stars would be to make it so that you could use the money from your previous hotels to upgrade your new ones. Would make more sense this way.",3,11,1.2.0
A Google user,"Its a great game as you need to think about how to manage finances and etc. However to remove adds from the game or buy a manger costs way too much money and is unreasonable, and i dont like the fact that you cannot transfer the money from one hotel to another, therefore im giving it 3 stars. It would be better if you solved these problems and also made a global competition in the game for like bitcoin or something. Make the game more interesting for a stronger purpose.",3,11,1.2.2
Naomi Raoul,"Started playing this game a couple days ago and I am Obssessed. Its really fun and addictive. I just wish that the money from the previous hotel could be used in the others (since I own them and all), so tht it wouldnt be so difficult and expensive to upgrade and stuff, but it makes it more challenging tht way, so not really complaining. Also, I havent been getting investors lately and Im not sure why...",5,11,2.3.3
A Google user,The first two hotels were fun to play. The third one is quite annoying to play. The guests only stay for one day therefore the restaurant is completely empty on the second shift because the guests are leaving. New guests if they check in after 6 PM they wont be able to enter the restaurant or beach bar because they spent too much time walking. Also the guests don't know the working hour of the facilities. Nice game but needs improvement.,4,11,1.2.0
A Google user,"It's a good game and it had potential, but once you reach the higher level to update each segment you want there's not much to do, your hotel makes money but then again there's nothing else to spend your money on. Maybe add more levels of update or let the money be transfered to other hotels?! I'll play while there's hotels to work on but once I reach every level on each hotel then I think I'm not going to continue playing it.",3,11,1.2.1
A Google user,"The game is fun if you play a few minutes every other hours. For a few coins, you can skip add, add a few boost. But as you can't transfer your gains from one hotel to another, it's pretty much meaningless. Worst, they implanted some ""Limited Time Event"" where your previous purchase aren't available anymore and request you to pay more money for options you previously had in the ""main game"". Tldr; fun but kind of a money grinder.",2,11,1.4.0
A Google user,Good game but annoying. As you upgrade rooms or services the star rating increases. However despite upgrading everything to the maximum I can only get 4 stars at each hotel. To get to the 3rd hotel you need 10 stars (5 from each previous hotel). Gems are awarded for completion of tasks (such as upgrading a bed to a certain level) but you can not earn enough gems to get all upgrades available. The only option is to pay for gems with real money. Seems to be a fault with the game.,2,11,1.2.0
A Google user,"Enjoyable and relaxing but one hotel is so spread out, guests don't get to do much, spend too much time walking to and fro, everything is open at the wrong times, and check in/out zips by in 4 hours!!! The restaurant has tons of seating but only serves 12, pool is huge but not really in use, spa is miles away and vacant most of the day. Loads of improvements could be made to this level.",4,11,1.7.1
A Google user,"It's not that it isn't fun, it's just that there are issues. I have upgraded everything in the 3rd hotel and have a full staff but I still can't get the 5th star so I am stuck. It sucks that you can't use the wealth you made on earlier hotels when you move to a new one. Some upgrades are REALLY pricey. I hate how there are so many tables in the restaurants but you can't use them all, but if you don't buy and upgrade them you can't get the needed 5 stars.",2,11,1.3.1
A Google user,"Too Easy and Too Basic. There's absolutely no intelligence needed for this game. It's mind numbingly boring. All you can do in the game is buy items for the hotel to increase revenue and hire/fire staff. There's nothing else to it. There's no decisions to make, so scenarios or events that happen. It's just 'customers come, stay, then leave'. And the graphics are appalling!!",1,11,1.2.0
Miranda Jensen,"I love this game. I even spent some money so I could get triple the money when I log on each day. I've been playing for about a month or so. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 is I've completed all the levels and go on further. They have been adding some short-term challenges, which is okay except I completed the first one. Then when they did the next one, it was exactly the same as the first except the only way you could get a presidential suite was to pay money. And I wasn't about to do that.",4,11,1.7.1
ScarySplice,I've decided to change my rating. It is a really good game the only complaint I have is the pricing for premium content is too high for my liking and without it it's impossible to complete any of the timed events that happen randomly. But the main part of the game is is good you just need time to complete things. Which I don't mind.,5,11,1.7.3
A Google user,I would give a 5 star if there was a way to transfer money from one hotel to the other. Or money that you make from hotels was usable at all of them like the gems. It would make it a lot more enjoyable. I give up after a few days because I get stuck due to not enough money. A lot of the add ins to the other hotels are expensive. I also find when I go to double my profits after being away for a couple of hours it's not giving me the extra cash. Which is frustrating.,3,11,1.2.1
Stephanie,"I did finish all levels and like all Codigames recommend playing with the No Ads. But must admit, this is my least favorite. Way too many rooms in the hotels and thus way too many repetitive clicks. Once u have built a few rooms all the rest become mundane. If more levels added I hope there are more unique items rather than tons of rooms",4,11,1.9.9
Jagad W,"I had play this game for quite some time now as I am at Arabian Nights Resort. I noticed my videos 2x rewards dont work although i finish watched them. Also when i left the hotel with 2x profits, I found out that i am losing by negative numbers of money. That doesnt make sense at all. It's a slow game each time u begin opening new resorts. But i cant stand with these bugs. Please put some real fix improvement.",2,11,1.8.4
Holly 5984,There is a very annoying bug in the game whenever I leave the game with all of the rooms occupied and then I come back again 7 rooms are empty. I tested it to see if it was just because I left the game for a long time but it isn't because I left it for one second and 3 rooms were empty so now I have to try and fill them up. If you can please fix this because it is such a great game.,3,11,1.8.4
A Google user,Ever since the latest update my game hasn't worked like it used to. It used to take me back to the current hotel I was working on and it doesnt anymore. It takes to just whichever one it wants which is very ANNOYING considering that I watch the ads for double profit and it doesnt tell you which hotel it's on until you've watched the ad. It is beyond aggravating to watch an ad for a hotel that you're no longer working on. I just wanna open my app and go straight to my hotel I ended on but no.,5,11,1.7.1
Amber Hall,"I'm adore all these cute games that Codigames has been throwing out but I'd like to see more variety of decorations and such between levels. The two giant heads and stack of cash in the bottom left corner do not encourage me to buy anything, they just clutter up the screen and are annoying. It would be more appropriate to have them in the store to buy gems.",3,11,1.8.4
A Google user,"Finally a more realistic idle clicker game!! Where 10 minutes after playing I'm not already a trillionaire. Love how you can lose cash. So far everything about it is great. I've been getting my rewards from videos, no glitches. I will report back as time goes. So far great Job C!",5,11,1.1.0
A Google user,"There are only 5 levels of hotels. The paid upgrades are useless without additional levels. Fun game but there is nothing to do once you complete the 5th hotel (Arabian Nights Resort). If there were additional levels or ways you could start a new hotel, apartment complex, condominium, etc. then I would give it 5 stars. 1 star is because the game is dead after completing 5th hotel. There needs to be additional ways to grow as a Hotel Tycoon.",1,11,1.3.0
A Google user,"It's an enjoyable game it's just that after completing the first hotel with 5 stars & complete all the tasks; there's no reason to go back to that hotel. There's nothing to do. Even the money you make doesn't transfer to the next hotel_____¡â_. Other than that I'd give it 5 stars. Edit: Yeah this game sets you up to spend money in order to advance. Not really ""free"". You'll also notice that you'll complete all the tasks and STILL not receive your 5 stars fair & square. DELETE",1,11,1.2.0
Murat __¨¹t,"This is not one of those games harass you with constant ads. However you still have to watch ads over and over and over and over. Because the game's in-game economy system depends on the ads. Yes, there is a payment system that removes all ads. However even if you pay the money, it feels like cheating. I wish these mobile games stop depending on the ads and give us proper games. But I am sure developers are happy with this ads based system and will give me a copy/paste reply.",2,11,1.8.4
A Google user,"This is a tentative 5 star review. First, this app is amazing. A great time killer for anyone that enjoys these idle games. You wont fly through the stages too fast and getting 5 stars feels like a reward. My only concern is the amount of stages. At 4 hotels to build, I feel like I'm about to max out without even being a month in. Updated: Yeah, 4 stages isn't enough. Edit 3/12/20: nah, this game is legit for what it is. Easily my favorite idle game.",5,11,1.4.2
Kingtropical 63,Hi i really enjoyed this game. Its fun but would be nice if you add a power up that makes your income x2 then it becomes x4 if you watch enough ads and add more level please. I know it would be too much to add but its okay if you disagree.,5,11,1.9.93
Tracie Easterling,"EDIT: Built all of the hotels, maxed them out. No more new hotels to open. Would have given more stars if completed hotels profits could be rolled forward to other hotels. Fun game, but I completed all levels in a week and now there's nothing left to play.",1,11,1.9.97
Natasha B,"This game keeps me occupied, and is lots of fun! I just wish the ads were a bit more appropriate __! Other than that this game is super__! This is the best tycoon I have ever played and lasts the longest! Thank you!",5,11,1.9.93

A Google user,"Too many ads to watch in order to progress in the game, but one purchase can get rid of that if you're willing to pay for it. I did, figuring to both help out the devs for the game and speed up my gameplay. It was a small price for me and totally worth it. I purchased the no ads+instant rewards and the double earn perk at the same time when they had a sale.",4,10,1.3.1
A Google user,"The game isn't bad and I have the no more ads. My biggest problem is if I minimize the game instead of going in to actually close it, I collect no money. It's a waste of time.

Either add more to completed hotels or allow me to use my part of that income on other activities or hotels.",3,10,1.2.0
S H,"Update: so... Weirdest complaint about a game ever but... They won't take my money __ I purchased the ad free thing, Great purchase, but it took forever for it to finally work. I contacted support and they didn't get back to me but I was able to purchase. I'm not going to email them everytime I want to spend $5-$10.

I get it they are pretty significant characters that are very beneficial but they are $10.99 a piece. That's outrageous! I'd spend at max $10 for both and even then that's rediclous for a few virtual characters! All around the pricing in this game is ridiculously expensive. As far as game play, it's pretty slow to advance, but still much fun.",3,10,1.1.1
A Google user,"Fun game, but has some annoying mechanics. I hate that after 2 hours of being out of the hotel your hotels close. It's too short a time frame. Also I wish you could transfer money from one hotel to the other.

Even if you can only transfer funds once when you first open a new hotel that would be great.",3,10,1.2.0
A Google user,The three stars are only temporary! Until a fix is issued. I'm on the ski resort hotel and my customers keep getting stuck between the front desk and dining room! I'll close the app completely to reset this bug and it'll take 25 minutes off my double money time. That's a little harsh considering I'm trying to correct an issue. Overall it's a fantastic game and I've been glued to it since Friday. I love the subtle movie and video game characters you guys have added in. (Add some more will you?!,3,10,1.2.2
A Google user,"The ad free option is definently the way to go to throughly enjoy this experience. I'm going on 20 gameplay hours and play a few times a day.

I'm hoping the developers add new locations because at this point I've already beat the game and I want more. Happy managing!",4,10,1.2.2
A Google user,Love the game. Pretty easy flowing and fun. The only thing I'd like to change is the money bit after you move on to another hotel. Once you've completely updated a hotel and have everything purchased you're just pointlessly collecting money for that hotel. Unless I'm missing something? I think it'd be cool if the money is all one whole amount you pull from for all your hotels.,5,10,1.3.0
C Ashton,"This hotel game is veryh good and fun, there are no glitchs or lags, and it is entertaining. The only bad thing is, that i wish that there could be more upgrades for things like the bar and restraunt in the city hotel, where you start.",4,10,2.8
Sri Carter,It's OK to pass time. I have been playing this game for a few years. It keeps me busy during down time. My only issue is there are no new hotels being added. It's been about 2 years since I had a new hotel. I have fully completed the 7 available hotels. Yea we get short limited hotels here and there but I would like to see more consistency with the development of new hotels.,3,10,2.8
A Google user,DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON HOTEL 3! Really wanted to rate this game high. I loved the gameplay and the graphics. It's simple but easy to enjoy and get lost in. However it feels like a grab at our wallets. You have to watch ads every few minutes to get anywhere with advancing. I was willing to bare all the ads but not the 7.99 (660 dimonds) I had to pay to get enough diamonds to advance in the game (third hotel) to find out I have one level left to play. Very disappointed.,2,10,1.2.0
A Google user,"As much as its a fun game, the ads keep coming up as a black screen, then kicking me out without my reward. It happens way too often and is starting to affect how much im enjoying my experiece. Other than that, the game is fun, great to kill time, and is definitely something i would recommend.",4,10,1.1.0
A Google user,I really enjoy the game as a idle timewaster however I don't like how once you've finished with a hotel you can't do anything with the money it keeps collecting since each hotel has it's own money anyway. It would be good if once a hotel was complete there was something you could do with the extra money such as buying perks (like x2 money for an hour ect) you could use in the other hotels. I also hate the new events as they're impossible without paying so not even worth attempting!!!,2,10,1.4.2
E Weaver,"Updates that don't fix? People have been constantly telling the developer of the gameplay issues, including bonuses not received, double profits not working and general gameplay bugs. It's the same thing everyday, no structure to it and very tiresome. Good for the first hour and then nothing to do. Even the event hotels are just the same as a normal hotel.",1,10,1.7.1
A Google user,"I love the game but it only lets me watch one video per session which is definitely frustrating, it gives me the option to watch a video for a perk but once I click to watch the video it just closes but the optional perk is still there; it will let me reject the video though.

Brianna M,"This game eats battery life like crazy. Plus it is fairly boring. There isn't much to do, and watching the hotel is pretty well pointless. Doesn't feel idle, doesn't feel interactive.

Carl Meehan,"Great game, but ads are long and the cost of going ad-free is expensive - ¡ê12.99!? Whilst other games are as low as ¡ê3.49 albeit permanent, it's still steep! Also, sometimes the investors disappear immediately after entering the hotel and on occasion watching an ad doesn't credit your hotels finances with money.",3,10,2.3.1
Tina S,It is frustrating to see that most of the negative reviews are concerning the same problem I am having with the ads.The worst part is the automatic reply every comment gets and this is STILL NOT CORRECTED.

Hopefully this is something that can be fixed,1,10,1.9.7
Kyle Corden,I don't like the dancing guy or free money. Rather not have him come back so fast. Also I would like if it did not force me to buy certain things like the bar first when I rather manage the hotel myself! Lastly you have to watch ads until you earn your first star as you can't make enough to support the building through normal means. Feels like cheating when I get free money takes fun away. Other wise great game.,3,10,1.9.95
Tracey parish,"Very good customer service. Which is essential if you have bought extras in a game. A few tech issues in game which each time customer service team fixed.

Being a UX Dev I kinda wanna make some suggestions tho. One is making more missions would be nice.

There can be found famous celebrities as characters. I did pick up Keanu Reeves, but i had to zoom in to see him more clear. Sincerely great work from you developers. Keep making it more awesome __",5,10,1.2.0
A Google user,Is fun apart from the fact you cant play unless you spend real money. Only way to progress in the game is to spend ¡ê10 to get rid of ads. Another ¡ê10 to continuously make revenue whilst not playing which is ridiculous. So you either spend a ridiculous amount of money to play this or you play hours on end each day and watching an ad every 30 seconds. Rather spend my money on a proper game.,1,10,1.7.1
A Google user,Hi I was new to this game and after a couple of days I really liked the concept of this game because it is where you have to manage a hotel but at the same time the advertisement is long and at the starting you always have to watch ads to get some money__otherwise there is no way otherwise getting slow money after some minutes but I recommend you guys reduce the number of ads and make money a little bit more easy to get and I know ads are your source of income but now you have way too players__,4,10,1.2.1
A Google user,"Finally beat this stupid game. I have to admit that it kept me busy for the first week. But the several weeks after was nothing but repetitive play and loooooooooonng waits. Dont waste your time buying in game ""perks"" they dont help how you'd expect. I spent $10 for something the game said unlocks everything but it didnt. Spent an additional $5 and felt like I just burned my money up. Didnt bother spending another 10 for a manager. The game is about waiting.",2,10,1.5.0
A Google user,"I am addicted to this game. I have paid to use the upgrades so.i dont have to watchs ads which is awesome. A few suggestions to make it better, can we have neighbours/friends that we can send gifts to or visit their hotels. Also please give us something to do with the money that is sitting in the other hotels. Its a shame that there is nothing more that can be done to them..also are my hotel clerks making out. One was on top of the other yesterday behind the desk !lol",4,10,1.2.0
A Google user,"Well I thought this was going to be a fun game. Now with the first hotel you keep making money and you can't build anymore and you can't take that money and transfer it into the next hotel. Wondering how you get enough stars to open the third resort, I've been waiting for about a week and I refuse to spend real cash......Too boring, uninstalling",1,10,1.2.0
A Google user,"Wonderful game. Loved it. thought I was gonna rate it 5 star considering the fact that it's a fantastic game. But in the ""EVENT HOTEL"", chefs(hired 2) don't work when they're supposed to and the housekeeping staff(hired 3) cleans only 1 room out of 3. I have to clean the remaining 2 by watching videos. I'll give 5 star after this is fixed.",1,10,1.7.1
Brock S,***EDIT(1) The update has still the same problem with ads loading or should i say not loading. You have to uninstall the game and then re install it to play realtime 2 hrs before uninstall and reinstall. I will wait for one more update then im removing this app.FIX THE GAME PLEASE! why mention bug fixes with the new update UNLESS YOU MEANT TO SAY YOU ADDED MORE BUGS...SERIOUSLY FIX IT. THANKS. ONCE FIXED ILL GIVE YOU BETTER RATING.,1,10,1.9.8
A Google user,"Love the game until I finished the 4th hotel. But what else is there to do, also why can't we use funding from other hotels. Got all 4 hotels to 5 stars. Enjoyed it untill then, but from there the game is dead. It's just a few weeks of play. I would add more stars if Devs can figure out a way to keep it alive even after completing 4 hotels.",2,10,1.2.1
Korn Freek,"Great game, but now I've completed all the hotels. The game no longer intrests me. Which is a shame, cause this was my 1st Tycoon Idle game I actually liked. Those constent clicker games, bore me. Please update and gives us a new hotel each update. Or I may have to uninstall the game :( P.S You can't transfer the money you've earned. To the new hotel, you are working on. Which sucks",3,10,1.8.4
A Google user,Great game for what it is. They dont choke you with ads. Thing that bothers me is why have staff that can only help 2 people. Example 5 chefs help 10 people yet you have 20 seats which they cant sit at if 10 are already there. only a few can wait in line yet you have 40 guests. The math doesn't add up. Also in one hotel many guest have too far to walk to get to the restaurant that it could close before they arrive. Why does a restaurant close at supper time? Regardless I still play daily,4,10,1.4.2
Muhammed Iqbal Hossain,This game deserves minus rating. Its full of bugs and only good for watching ads. Event hotels keep getting deleted and after complain they do nothing to fix it. Restaurant/Hotel room becomes vacant even after full update when u leave the game. Profile booster goes to zero if u r inactive for 30mins even when its full and supposed to stay active for 2hour. All the room/restaurant customer goes to zero if u do not continuously play. After completing a hotel the generated money is all useless.,1,10,1.8.1
Sam Curtis,"I do like the game but it's currently having connecting issues when ever I try to use gems or getting rewards from the Codi Hotels (it's mostly not my wifi), I'm also getting notifications that my hotels are closed even though I literally just checked it",4,10,1.9.91
Mahshid Gh,This game is so good and entertaining. the only thing that bothers me is that I can't transfer money from one hotel to another. I know it is a game that you have to build a hotel from scratch but what else can you do with all the money that your 5 star hotels make?,4,10,1.9.93
Maliha Mollick,Super super super interesting... I love it... But there is a server problem.. I hope they will solve it soon,5,10,1.9.93
A Google user,Videos aren't working again.,5,10,1.6.0
A Google user,"Fun to kill time with. Needs work for more play time, feels incomplete. It would be nice if it was a little more in depth. Customize the hotel more. Maybe just adding more services like pool, spa, fitness center, etc. Possibly invintory managment. buying specific supplies, getting deliveries. Or even giving the restaurant/bar a star rating and more personal upgrades/customization. It would give a cause to play longer and watch more adds lol :)",1,9,1.7.1
A Google user,Once you get to the next to last hotel they make it impossible to get to the last one without spending money. You upgrade the entire thing and can't get all the stars unless you buy diamonds to upgrade extras. Disappointed. REALLY loved the game. Didn't mind all the ads. It's tons of fun! But I uninstalled cause it's impossible to go further.,1,9,1.3.1
A Google user,"GAME PLAY PROGRESSION IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON WATCHING ADS!!! In the beginning it was okay because I enjoyed the game. But quickly learned that you will need to watch 30+ ads daily for progression. That's entirely too much! Ad free version is way too expensive. Add all of that to the fact the ads DONT always load (therefore no reward) and frustration can start to mount. While concept, gameplay and graphics are awesome, I would like to see less ads.",4,9,1.1.1
A Google user,"Great game. Straight to the point and playing straight away with very little intro. A few ads in game but I don't mind because it helps you improve your hotel (They don't pop up every 5 minutes. You choose to watch them for more money) . Theres an option to buy the game to take the ads away, which I'm very well thinking of doing.",5,9,1.7.1
A Google user,"The game is amazing I have to say but there's just one thing that annoys me: I have all my rooms occupied, and when I change to another hotel just to check and then revert back, suddenly only two of my rooms are occupied. It doesn't retain my customers. I wish this is just a technical glitch or bug they can fix. Other than that, I play this game the entire day and I love it! I just hope the developers can fix it asap.",4,9,1.3.0
A Google user,"I gave it a try, finished first hotel. No thanks, uninstalling it. You basically have to watch ads every minute in order to make enough money to progress your hotel at a reasonable enough pace to be considered interesting. Your most significant source of income for upgrades is from watching ads. It's ""addictively boring"". Ad, ad, upgrade, wait, ad, ad, upgrade, wait... rinse and repeat.",1,9,1.2.0
A Google user,"It's fine. Good concept. Poorly implemented.Unfortunately you have to reliy on a lot of ads to make any amount of significant money. Or you can pay to remove ads, like I did, almost $20 AU, which speeds things up so much more so you actually feel like you're playing. Now if you've paid that ridiculous amount to remove ads the gameplay begins. It can actually be fun but there's a lot of repetitive play to it which becomes old very fast. Yes I'm very salty I had to pay alot for this mediocre game.",2,9,1.2.1
Richard Francis (Richie),"The one and most problem that am having is with the ads, why is it that it's always closing the app when you click on it and I don't think it's doing it on its own I believe the developers created it that way. so it's just one out of ten times you really get the chance to get the money the ads are displaying to you and that is unfair because every minute or two they send it and this is the problem it cause and that makes the game start to get boring..It's best you don't put these ads in it then",4,9,2.4
A Google user,"Was great until the last update. Now the reward videos are messed up - when I log back in I watch the video for x2 rewards and when it's over I click 'X' and it tells me ""ate you sure because you'll loose your reward?"" Even though I've watched the whole thing. And the dancing man offers me videos for extra money and the same thing happens, or the video doesn't even load at all.",2,9,1.3.1
Zara Mohsin,I usually get bored playing games where we need to wait for an item to build/cook/get produced but this was a really addictive and interesting game. I love the theme related items and its exciting to earn money and upgrade things. Overall a really fun experience. Would love to play more of these types of games.,5,9,1.7.1
Jordan Stevens,"It was a fun game to play at first, then on like the 3 chapter/ hotel it started to bug out. Maids weren't cleaning the rooms. Customers were checking into the hotel but would leave the hotel and yesterday while I was playing the game my phone started to glitch on me turning the screen on and off on repeat to where it was difficult to restart my phone.",2,9,2.7
A Google user,"The game is great, my only problem I have is with the dinning area. The dinning room could only have two seats taken and customer still go to wait in line as if there isn't any free tables. Or say two customers are eating together, one finishes and the person in line sits with the person that's still eating, even though there are other empty spots. It's just really annoying and makes no sense.",4,9,1.2.0
Julie,"Hi, this Hotel Tycoon game is simple one. Small tutorial to lead you the way if first time playing . Lots of leveling up some adverts if you wanna make quick in game cash to fancy up the hotel rooms and other features !! Enjoy game. The game did freeze on me in beginning twice when I was progressing a bit. I bounced out and came back in and now things are smooth . BTW Google Play also has similar leveling up game but it's Night Club & Bar with nice relaxing club music . Give it a try too !!",5,9,2.4
A Google user,"It will keep you very busy, especially with having the money to buy new things. I wish there were goals to make the game more fun its just a free play. Also i wish there was a way to buy more rooms.. I hate the fact that buying generaters or upgrading is so much money. It does take quite a long time to get money. And what can i do besides competing a task for gems. What make it fun is that you can watch ads to raise the money or even double it.. Just make a few genius updates and ill be fine!",3,9,1.3.1
A Google user,Lots of fun but seems very short. Paid ¡ê20 for both perks only to complete the game in about a week. Lots of bugs to iron out (restarting the app resolves these). Hoping that more features will be added in time - including more hotels and the possibility to put in-game money towards something once a hotel is maxed out. Update 2020-01-21: there are now 4 hotels but all are complete and it has been some time since the last one.,5,9,1.2.1
Chris,"Such an hilariously-high amount of ad begging. I feel like 1/4 of the screen is taken up by ""pay $11 for thing"" buttons, or the ever-present giant VIP ""watch ad for game money"" button. You can watch ads to add time to a 2x-income multiplier, but each ad only adds 10 minutes to a maximum of 2 hours. You'll spend more time watching advertisements than playing.",2,9,1.7.1
A Google user,"Good game to pass time. Interesting concept. Graphics are funky and vibrant, and well detailed. Really wish they added more hotels as Ive completed the game so far. And have done; for ages now. But theres no updates. There is so much more they can do. I will give it 4 stars until they add more hotels to upgrade then will rate 5.",4,9,1.2.1

Get bonus cash for upgrades : watch an ad. Need a room cleaned : watch an ad. Need guests : watch an ad. Without x2 income and without bonus cash you will not be able to progress.

A Google user,"This is a very simple yet entertaining game. I usually play this while I'm bored and it instantly cures my boredom. There is absolutely no lags bugs or anything like that. It runs smoothly and I definitely reccomend this game. In addition if you go off the game for maximum two hours, you still earn money for the 2 hours you were off which can really help when going back on so you can upgrade your hotel and pay your staff.",5,9,1.5.0
A Google user,Would have been a cool game if it wasnt FLAWED. If you dont max out the number of stars needed to make it to the next level your eating potential is DONE!!! Your allowed to keep playing (which there is nothing to do once all task are complete) but cant increase your star rating for your hotels to earn more hotels. And I spent money on this game just to never be able to get another hotel after level two. And you cant start over. Super disappointed,3,9,1.4.2
A Google user,"Fun game but needs work. My first hotel earned 4 stars. My next 2 earned 5 each. I cnt move on to the next hotel bc I don't have enough stars. I went back to my first hotel, there's nothing else to be done. There are way too many ads for this game. It would be nice if some of the money from the previous hotel rolled over to the next one.",2,9,1.4.2
Greg Owens,My go to game at the moment. I only started playing this game a few days ago and I've now managed to unlock the second hotel. Unlike most idle games you don't get loads of cash really fast it is a bit of a grind but it's still a very fun game to play. You have to rely on investments and watching ads to get decent amounts of money which is always random sometimes 2k sometimes 10k. It would be better if you could earn a bit more money a bit faster though other than that it's a great game to play.,5,9,1.7.1
Brandon Wagner,"Great game, very fun! Quick to learn, but takes a while to master. Is there a way to reset the game but keep all my purchased managers and earned special managers? Now that I have earned most of them, and have made it to Camelot, I would love to start over. Again, great game!",5,9,1.8.4
A Google user,The game is great so far but it could be better like dont make it hard to earn money to upgrade things to make more money at the very beginning of the game its very tedious and time consuming just to earn the little bit of money to upgrade stuff plus you have to save some money so that your staff dont quit on you i know you guys wanted a feel of running a real hotel in a game an it feels like that trust me but its also to be fun.,5,9,1.1.0
A Google user,"Fab! I got this game thinking it was another idle upgrading game. It's more than that, you really have to think about how you're playing or things can go wrong. Devs have put a lot of time into the interactions and animations of the visitors and staff. The only thing I would say is once the hotel is complete along with all the upgrades, could their be a way of personalising each room? - I'm also not sure how to tell why my guest in their room is angry?",5,9,0.1.1
Susan McSweeney,"Love this app. It's fun and engaging. I would totally give this a 5 star rating but my only issue is the ad glitch. Occasionally, the ad will glitch and allow me to watch the video but then not give me the money or I will click to watch for the money and will be kicked out which restarts the game and the VIP will have gone. On other occasions, it will glitch and the VIP will be there but I will click on him and nothing happens. Please fix this bug as it happens with over 10,000 involved.",4,9,1.9.93
Stacey Liddle,"I have been playing this game for about a week and all was going well, until last night. I cant watch any videos to get money or double the profits or anything. It just flashes black and white and does nothing. I can't even get out of it, i have to close the app down and open it again. Then I loose the x2 profits. Please fix this!",1,9,1.8.2
Lee Wen,"Its a good game. Slow pace, item price is reasonable, more like a reality game. I agreedthe with most players, watching ads will help in the beginning, but after u updated some items, the cash will keep generating. Just dont over hire too much of employee. And, why cant we transfer money between hotels? It doesnt make sense when first hotel is max, but cant spent the money in other hotels..the event is also impossible to reach 5% without paying, after watching tons of ads, still barely near it",3,9,1.8.4
Lemi Rald,"The game has great potential but is in need of some serious optimization. Guest pathing is a bit askewed. Hotels are so large that it'll take guests 2 hours of in game time to get from one place to another. Guests will path to closed hotel services wasting valuable in game time. A second of real time is about 2.5 minutes in game and the guests are slow to get anywhere. Exiting the game for even a few seconds will turn your ""no vacancy"" hotel into a ""10 rooms available"" when you return.",3,9,1.7.2
Charlie Mears,Currently on the Imperator Palace. Not sure if its a bug for this hotel or a bug thats developed coz of the last update. It keeps glitching out and not giving me any afk money. I am not sitting here for hours watching my money go up like $20 every 2mins or so waiting to get enough money to do anything. Uninstalling now coz to many bugs. This. The x2 thing does not give x2 money like it says it does. Getting cleaners just not getting up and doing their job no matter how many times i fire/rehire,2,9,2.2.1
Veronica Figueiredo,"It's a really good game and I enjoyed a lot! Unfortunately I'm gonna have to uninstall since there hasn't been any more update on the game for 2 years, still the same hotels so this means that the developers are not interested in this project for now.

Issues I'm having with it now since the update is after so many videos watch sometimes just even 2 to collect things it glitches and won't let you watch videos to gain anything.

There are still glitches and bugs, but they're mostly visual.",4,8,1.5.0

This model needs to be followed for your next game.",5,8,1.2.1

PLEASE stop doing those, which are entirely repetitive anyway, and start adding new, ""real"" levels!",5,8,
Regina,"Great time killer overall and easy to play. I purchased the ad remover, but the upgrades altogether are definitely way too expensive, hence why I didn't get the other ones. The reason for the 2 stars is because the events are nearly impossible to achieve if you don't get the vip package, which only lasts 4ish days anyway. It doesn't carry over to the next one which makes it ridiculously greedy! Even without ads, I struggle to get even one star during the events. Game needs some adjusting",2,8,1.7.2

I'm looking forward to more content being added as it's definitely going to be a game I'd love to see be expanded.,5,8,0.1.1
A Google user,The graphics are gorgeous but you either have to constantly watch ads or pay in order to make any considerable progress. This is not an idle game because after 2 hours of offline you won't get anything. Also when your phone goes to sleep in game no progress is made and it just pauses the game and income somehow,2,8,1.3.0
A Google user,"I give this game a full 5 stars!! The graphics are amazing and this game is soooo addicting. I would say that it is a little hard to make money without watching ads, but that is the only bad part of this amazing app! So amazing graphics, addicting, and ads are normally optional (recomended though). Get this game now!!!!!",5,8,1.5.0
Lyndsay Matchett,"So far it's ok, I have played these games for a long time but this one seems deliberately slow paced, especially the special events, it is not possible to go very far in the special events without buying bundles for real cash, that just makes it a waste of time to even start. There are similar games available that are a lot more free and enjoyable.",2,8,1.8.4
A Google user,"The game ok, but the event game is a fix. To be able to build Presidential Suites you have to buy (real money) the VIP Pack. I think you should be able to build the Presidential Suites, but if you want to build quickly then you can buy the VIP Pack. It should be a option NOT a choice, build and take time to build or buy pack and get Presidential Suites straight away. I don't mind watching adds to double you takings while away from game.",2,8,1.4.4
A Google user,"This is a good idle game but it only lasted me 1 month. I have purchased remove Ads as I do not want to watch video every single time the VIP comes. Thus, I have completed this game pretty fast. I hope you guys can come out with more hotels n resort. Also, it should increase the difficulty as most of the time I'm just waiting for my profit to upgrade things n hire staffs. If there is no more updates on the game, I'm gonna uninstall it since I have nothing to do anymore.",4,8,1.2.2
K G,"It's great until it's not. I've run into the problem of the ad button doesn't load it just circles forever. I've closed out of the game, forced stopped it and cleared the cache, reset my internet, restarted my tablet and it still doesn't work",3,8,2.5.1
A Google user,"I'm really enjoying the game but watching an ad for only a 10 minute boost is kind of ruining the gameplay. You have to watch 12 ads for a 2 hour boost, so you have to watch a full 6 minutes of just ads. Comparing to other games it feels way to ad heavy.",3,8,1.1.0
Courtney Docherty,"It's a good game but needs some work, doubling money to watch a video doesn't work sometimes doesn't even give the amount, also the restaurant keeps saying I'm in debt but then changes to I'm making profit, there's just some thing the game needs improvements, like a really good update...",3,8,1.9.93
A Jackson,I'd 1st like to say thank you for resolving my gem issue. Okay. So I enjoy the game. It would be nice to have the option to transfer some of the cash from your other hotels. I wish the guest wouldn't do the same thing at the same time. Make it a lil more realistic. Also it would be nice to be able to change the schedule. Like have housekeeping clean before everyone gets back from breakfast. Oh why spend gems on things that don't get used?? Like the mud bath..,4,8,1.7.2
Ravishankar Venkataraman,"Game has potential, graphics ar good (for mobile top down game) has a nice layout but there isn't a sense of challenge. Anytime I run out of money I can watch an ad (which is annoying) but still I can do that and get a boost and I feel watching ads is part of the gameplay if not you would be sitting idel waiting for some cash to make a upgrade. It's a good game but could be better",3,8,1.8.4
A Google user,"It's an amazing game, can't wait for the next update... I've nearly done up both the available hotels, when is the next one,.. where is it? More upgrades!!!?? Hope so love this game, this and the idle theme park tycoon one are my life I only play them and when this one gets bigger I'm spending the ¡ê10.49 to get rid ov the ads! One problem I have is on my mission list it says...: inaugura un hotel como Dios manda. Im English and only speak English so have no idea what that means...",5,8,0.3.1
A Google user,"The overall game is great other than the fact that it takes a long time to generate some actual cash. I would suggest may be a calendar to bring people back everyday with a different reward, such as cash, gold diamonds and other things. Maybe increase how much each patron to the hotel spends during their stay. But overall I am enjoying the concept of the game.",3,8,0.3.1
A Google user,"I love this game a lot! The only thing is getting money is hard. I've completed the first hotel, and im on the second, and money is very tight. I cant afford to pay my employee's because i upgrade all my things. Also, why have a power limit? There is still loads to upgrade in the first hotel, and i had to stop becayse of a power limit, though i updated all the batteries and generators max. But overall i love this game! Good job! Ps it would be 5 stars if not for the power limit and money",4,8,1.1.1
Alex Lea,"I gave this game about a week but now I know all it does is frustrate me. It's a free game so I expect to be able to actually play it a little. Instead I watch a thousand ads because I don't want to spend real money to get rid of them. Just found my first event and I don't see how it's possible to even get one star without paying real money, which is completely ridiculous. Definitely deleting it now.",1,8,1.7.3
A Google user,"I used to love this game, until this most recent hotel add. It starts you off with 1 room I've been playing for the past week and have yet to get enough money to even get a second room. My daughter plays as well and said her hotel started with $250,000 and she was able to added rooms to get going. My acct balance was $0 when I started, I don't know if that was a glitch for her or a glitch on mines. Another thing that I don't like is you can't purchase money only gems and gems can only do so much",3,8,1.7.1
Peter Linaker,"Addictive at first, but I believe improvements could be made for example starting a new hotel the accumulated cash from previous hotels should be carried over when you first start because if a hotel is complete previous ones become irrelevant, you can't do anything more to them unless new rooms or services are constantly added secondly when it comes to events give alternative options to unlock rather than needing to spend real money and finally im up to the second to last hotel please make more.",3,8,1.9.9
A Google user,"Loved it. Great game. However to proceed to the 3rd level hotel you need 5 stars on at least one of your two hotels, which you can ONLY achieve by spending gems. The game literally doesnt give you enough gems to do this, so you would therefore be forced to spend money to unlock the next hotel. Absolute joke, and am immediately uninstalling. If you are not prepared to spend money to advance, do NOT install this game, as you will have no choice.",1,8,1.2.0
Dawson Kilmister,"Acquiring the speciality furniture within the hotels should not have to be exclusively purchased using gems, as completionists will find it very irritating that they're missing out on fully upgrading the hotel. I think a good solution would be to allow gem usage for most if not all hotel upgrades while also allowing the specialty decor to be purchased with cash too.",3,8,1.8.4
A Google user,"Decent game and would rate higher except 1. The 2x bonus for watching a video only gives 10 minutes of the bonus up to two hour max. Other similar games give 30 min up to 5 hour max. 2. I maxed out the 2x bonus from videos and that should have lasted till 6:40PM my time...it is only 5:30 PM my time and that bonus is now gone requiring me to watch more videos, a full ONE HOUR AND 10 MINUTES before it should have been up so I basically watched 12 ads for 50 minutes of 2x bonus.........",1,8,1.1.1
Megan Gilchrist,"Not a true great, but not one of the reeeally bad ones. Am usually one for long-form management games and most are a bit quick for my pace and i buzz through, but this one seems to drag a bit in early game. Hoping it gets better as it pregresses.",4,8,1.9.95
Go Pei Shen,It is so worse that the videos have limited for us to watch and earn extra money. Have to wait for 24 hours for the videos to be back to normal and this feeling is so sucks.

Nurun Nahar Dora,"It's great,but When you start playing, it's great. But I your first hotel, when you get over 6000 bucks, the game forces you into getting the bar. Now I had a lot planned at that point . But due to the bar, I am now almost broke. So uhh, that is my only complaint.",4,8,1.8.1
Mary Dumas,"I paid for a booster pack in the game, for $5.49. They took my money but didn't give me the booster pack. Nothing short of THEFT! Update: I demanded a refund from Google Play and was told that they'll decide if they want to give me my money back, but if they decide to, it would be up to ten business days to get it. Takes one second to steal my money, but two weeks to give it back? Sounds like a money hungry conglomerate to me. If I don't get my refund, I'm reporting the charge as fraud.",1,8,1.8.1
Denny M,"Way too many ads to watch with little reward. Also hate the fact that if you close the game for 1 minute you lose half of the customers already in the hotel, especially during an event it is frustrating",2,8,1.8.4
A Google user,"I do enjoy this game, but the problem is needing to have x amount of stars to progress to each new hotel, and on top of that, there's only 5 hotels. You can't progress as needed because you need gems, paid for with real money, to buy the necessary items to make your hotel a 5 star hotel. You need 9 stars to progress to the third hotel, 15 for the fourth and 20 for the last. Each gem item costs between 15-100 some odd gems. 1 star due to unable to progress without spending money.",1,8,1.3.0
ItzGoldy,"Great game! I think it would be cool if you added card decks because most of your new games have them and if we buy everything with gems we can buy the card decks, and there's a bug where the vip disappears as soon as he starts dancing please fix the bug.",5,8,1.9.95
hassan rafi,In first hotel it¡¯s Okay. But when you make that hotel a 4-star hotel then you unlock the second hotel. That's where my problem begins. it¡¯s already hard to manage the hotels. With added extra price for everything. You can't even use your own money from other hotels. NOW what kind of logic is it? It¡¯s my money i should be able use my money wherever i want to spent... But no there is no option for that.. Just make the money same FOR every hotels. Now in the second hotel i don¡¯t even Have enough m,2,8,1.8.2
A Google user,Don't play this game. Events are impossible for freetoplay players. VIP Packs costs 12$ PER EVENT. They're not permanent. Each events requires separate VIP pack purchases. --- I'm done playing your games thanks to your greedy business model. I paid a lot of money for your games because I had fun but charging money for VIP packs on every events? And those events only last for about 3-4 days? That's way too greedy. Thanks for the fun and you can keep the money. Farewell.,1,8,1.4.2

John Szala,"So you know what the best part of this gaming app is? It's got the most awesome elevator music that I've ever heard. The melodies go round in my head about as often as my eyes roll up and around due to the fact that upon opening the app it constantly freezes.... it's impossible sometimes to even get as far as getting the option to double your earnings because, as mentioned the app becomes unresponsive. Perhaps the app is overloaded with a tad too many ads? Hmm, maybe...?",3,7,1.7.1
A Google user,"It would be 4 star, but the santa level completely sucks and it lacks a theme strongly compared to other levels. Can't wait to just be done with this hotel. It also has a lot of recycled furniture from previous hotels. Nothing unique. But other than this level, I've enjoyed all the others. Edit: I changed the game to 4 stars because they just added a new hotel level after the santa level. It was great and looks like they put a lot of effort into it compared to other levels.",4,7,1.3.1
A Google user,"It's okay, if you don't mind paying real money. It's not an idle game by default - it only runs offline if you pay to enable that. I also never really got the sense that I was a hotel tycoon. You get very little say in how your hotels run - you can't change the restaurant's hours, for instance. You also can't move money from finished hotels to the one you're working on. Lastly, there are quite a few visual problems: paintings hanging on windows, for instance.",3,7,1.2.0
Maddox Bago,"It's a very simple game but with a lot in it. You keep up with everything and you're great. I also like minimal ads and cheap options to further yourself iui n the game. I would like it if you added a button to the upgrade screens where you can upgrade all in a room if you can afford it. It would save a lot of time where you have 23,000,000 and can upgrade more then one entire room at a time. Other then that I absolutely love the app.",5,7,1.7.1
A Google user,"5 STAR POTENTIAL, but too short with poor customer service. It is basically unplayable without the ad remover for $10. I enjoyed it so much without ads that I spent another $10 to allow my hotel to stay open while I was offline. However, I have finished every level in less than 2 weeks.

Not spending my money on this game, especially when there are bugs like this.",2,7,1.7.1
A Google user,Played through 3 hotels and a couple event hotels. This game is super fun and easy to get into. A couple issues though: every single guest seems to follow the same pattern and makes for relly time consuming walking around. It would be great if guests had randomized order. Also it made little sense to my why the restaurants could only hold a max of 12-ish guests when the dining halls look like they can seat at least 20. I wouldn't mind hiring waiters to get more people fed!,5,7,1.5.0
Beverley Jung,"It's alright, kind of fun at first but after the first hotel you realise it's the same boring grind over and over again. The hotels don't really have any substance, you don't make any creative decisions. It's just about upgrading to the next thing and accumulating more money which then devalues as upgrades cost even more. Ads are optional but you will have to watch them if you want to progress faster",3,7,1.7.1
Jackoya Lue,The game is quite fun. The only issues (or add one that could be cool) is a downgrade system where of you don't see a hotel for a while it begins to revert. Only because when you move on from a hotel it just makes more money and there's nothing to do anymore. Another thing that would be great is a money transfer system from hotel to hotel.,4,7,1.7.3

When I click the option to watch an ad for extra $, x2 profits etc, it disappears like I've watched the ad, but an ad doesn't play and I dont get bonuses. Basically the only thing that makes this game playable is getting a boost from watching the ads, so I'll probably uninstall this game soon.",2,7,1.3.1
OPM ¡°Er¡± Genos,Great game and im happy to watch some ads. However there's a bug with the cleaners. They suddenly stop working halfway and stand there. I checked the time and it was only 11am and they should be working. The only way to get rid of the bug is to restart the game. I will give 5 stars once this bug is fixed,3,7,2.6.1

A Google user,"The structure of the game is good enough but clicking a guy to watch ads is basically the key to advancement. So much so, that any other decisions you make are moot.

Erica Lu,It was really fun to begin with but there's a glitch every so often that won't allow you to load any ads.

Kevin Cuichta,"The events are nice, but more hotels would be better. We don't need a new manager or to upgrade the ones we have if we have completed all of the hotels that could use them. It's just a waste of time, and definitely not a reason to spend money, if we don't have a purpose for the new/improved managers. More hotels are needed. Perhaps an underwater hotel, or ice hotel. There should be a little more in the hotels to do. What about ballrooms? Perhaps multiple levels of each hotel. It needs more.",2,7,1.8.4
A Google user,"So far it's a great game, passes the time during my quarantine and its pretty addictive, but in a good way. Only negative is that the upgrades they offer cost over $10 each, and there are multiple upgrades you can buy, but it is totally possible to play this game without them.",5,7,1.6.0
Julie Richards,If you want a game you do nothing really this is it. You do need to invest real money to get the better manager and to get the exclusive items in your hotel. Plus on the special 3 day events expect to invest at least $12 or so to achieve 3 stars in 3 or 4 days I feel like the game is a dead end game. Once your hotel is complete it keeps gathering coins without a purpose. You can not use them in any other motel or upgrade anything after a point. It is not really fun,3,7,1.8.4
Emily Coulter,I loved the game until for some reason the investors stopped showing up and I couldn't watch a video to double profits anymore. I had to check every possible issue that could have stemmed from my phone just to find that the app wasn't offering me these services anymore. They won't load. I can't make substantial progress anymore.,3,7,2.4
A Google user,The game is really well put together. There are not a bunch of ads that randomly pop up out of no where like past games. The ads that do happen are ones you decide you want to see.

A Google user,"Spend your time for more valuable things, NOT TO THIS GAME. It's time killer for sure. But for you to advance in the game you need to watch a LOT of ads.

A Google user,I'm very disappointed I was having alot of fun with this game I even paid for the manager. Once I had updated all the spots in the hotels it ended with nothing to do. I suggested ways to make it more fun I even asked for more hotels but it seems that this is a very short game. So in conclusion I loved the game when there was something to do. When it is done I can find anything to do. Very big bummer!!!!!____,1,7,1.3.1
Breann Walton,"Bugged The second hotel would not keep guests in the double rooms. If I switched views to go to a different hotel there would no longer be guests there. I tried it several different ways, (middle of night, just waking up, etc), all had the same result. Also any new rooms besides the 2 singles are also bugged like this",1,7,1.7.2
H Y,"Played and compared quite a few tycoon games. - Fun, able to create different sizes of rooms and amenities like restaurant, spa, bar etc. - Managing employees also takes strategy to ensure profit comes in. - VIP comes around and provide cash after watching ads. However, the cash is rather low compared to other games. - It'll be better if the cash earning process can be slightly easier, otherwise it takes way too long to be able to advance through the levels. Overall great game!",4,7,1.9.93
Sam Benito,"Pretty decent idle game; it's interesting to just watch the hotel guests move around to the different activities etc. However, a couple of suggestions to improve things: 1. Have a central upgrades area where we can use the money from the 5-star hotels to upgrade general things like customer speed, multiplier timer, income from activities. It's the thing I love most about another Codigames app - Idle Supermarket Tycoon. 2. Make events more rewarding! It's so frustrating to spend hours upgrading little things only to not meet the 15 million mark and thus get NOTHING from the event. Should earn diamonds for lower targets, perhaps every 1 million? On the same note, when you DO finally earn a VIP, their increase is pointless! 5% increase, really? Should be 100 or 200% for the first star! 3. 2 hour limit on hotel opening - why? Some of us have to sleep! It should be minimum 4 hours, with the ability to upgrade as per point 1. Ditto for the 10 minute multiplier - either 10 mins for 5x or 1 hour for 2x, also upgradeable.",4,7,1.7.1
A Google user,Has so much potential let down by poor code. There's so many glitches that ruin gameplay. Don't even get me started on the ads. I've paid ¡ê20 to get the most enjoyment out of the game and I feel robbed (no ads ¡ê10 and hotel to stay open during afk ¡ê10) Glitches start happening the most during the 3rd hotel. Cleaners don't clean. They just stay in their room. Guests get stuck and don't move. Also on the 3rd hotel with the beach bar added. All the guests seem to want to sunbathe at 10pm-12am?!,1,7,1.2.0
Blescid Blake,Codigames has been telling everyone for a couple weeks now that they're going to contact the ad providers. Still nothing has been done about the ads.

A Google user,"This should be called, THE HOTEL MANAGER. Not Hotel Tycoon. Everytime you finish one Hotel, you cannot invest any profit in building other Hotels. So when you are finally seeing nice amounts of money rolling in and you can expand, you start a new one from scratch which takes days just to get an extra room. Even though the money is nothing when you start, every Hotel starts to get more and more expensive. Calling this game Hotel Tycoon is totally misleading. Shame.....",2,7,1.3.1

That is unless you pay for special event packages. A clear pay for play scenario. Ignore the events.",1,7,1.7.1

When someone comes with someone, they should do things together. 3. If the restaurant has spare tables, people should be allow to sit. 4. Using spa as example; if all the nodes are taken, the people still get out to change node and then get back in. Either don't get out if no nodes or have a waiting node. 5.

Shanon Fritz,I really like this game but it keeps crashing after like 5 minutes of playing this started happening after I updated. Not to mention but in the real world you when you build chains you can take the money you earned from a previous successful chain to help build the next new one. It gives real meaning and incentive to finish those other hotels since they're still collecting money but you can't do anything with that money.,3,6,1.7.2
Todd Ipock,"This is a great game. I have not been credited for hundreds of thousands of dollars for watching the ads though. That would be the only thing I am disappointed about.

A Google user,"I would like more items in the game. I feel the balance between what your offering in return for all those ads I have to watch just doesn't compare.

I just feel if you added more items in the hotel to upgrade then it would be a good balance. Maybe it will get better the more I play???",4,6,1.1.1
A Google user,"This game has an amazing idea for a style of game, but executes it so horribly. Ignoring the rant about the fact that you sit around and do barely anything, you never pull in enough money to ever get anywhere in the game without watching ads, if you don't want to shell out cash like a normal person... it's mind-numbingly boring, with a ""goal"" of getting a new hotel, but with the issue of never being able to get to that goal.",2,6,1.2.0
MJE Houts,Awesome game!!! One thing thats not working is the video to skip night time and the double profits for 10 minutes. Also the real estate car is not coming anymore so my progress is very slow. Is there a way to fix this? Thanks _ EDIT: The suite wasnt part of the main hotel building lol my mistake.,4,6,1.9.9
A Google user,"The 30-sec ads are very helpful in sustaining the hotels cause they usually pop-up when you really need the cash. It isn't too long and it gives more money than I expected. Although, it'll base on your hotel's balance of course. So enjoyable and simple yet it makes you analyze how you manage your profits. I just hope for more hotels 'cause I'm almost at the last one. Having time-limited events or hotels may make this game more fun and entertaining to play. Please put it in future updates!",5,6,1.2.1

However, I saw that we can change the wage of employees if sort for money (not paying employees result to resigning) and I can't find that option. If someone can teach me how, I'll change the review to 4 or even 5 star. The game is really addicting and expect lots of ADs to help you progress.",3,6,1.1.1

Tzampas Professional,"Really nice game with great concept, but only to the point of completing the first hotel, because when you go to the next one, you find out that hotels have different balances, which is pointless. I mean, what's even the point of having a fully upgraded hotel which has , let's say, 70k saved up, and you can't even use them to the next one???? All that money has gone to waste, and apparently your time. Got so pissed when I found that out, and uninstalled it at once. Only for that it's a 1/5.",1,6,

I'm losing way to much cars for a fully upgraded parking lot and I'm only using the radio campaign. The cars should be processed through alot faster. I should be having a hard time filling my (fully upgraded) parking lot with just a small champagne as the radio is. Fix this to be way more balanced please this is very frustrating.,1,6,1.8.3

You can, but you gain the things youd pay for extremely easy, (w/o paying) and that doesn't affect the stars. You can still get each hotel to 5 stars :)",4,6,1.2.1
Amy Plummer,love this game and just opened a new hotel starting with little money. Everything is so much more expensive and I think you should be able to transfer money from hotel to hotel.

Gweto Kannabis,It a great game. There's just too many ads you gotta watch and half the time the ad videos don't work. Other then that it's a pretty fun game. I'm still playing it now didn't uninstall yet.,5,6,1.8.4
Teresa Carty,"Its total kool. I like to play it alot. It teaches me patients that a 5 star hotel isnt built in a day. Also money management, how to manage your expenses. Also teaches you what you should invest in to make your business profitable. So in all I love this game. You should try it, who knows one day you may own your own hotel from this game experience.",5,6,1.7.1
A Google user,"New Game event system is a pay-to-win. Before you question, note that all VIP purchases for the event only last till the event ends. On next one? Pay again. They are the only ways to reach 2 & 3 stars. Tested by no Ad buyer. Even so it isn't worth bcs the game lack of content, but highly doubt they will introduce insane time gates.",1,6,1.4.2
Resuri Kuro,"I can't believe it, seriously, what the developers is thinking? Ads and buyable packs is one thing, but if you hire bartender or chefs, they can service ONLY 2 people at most! 2, to serve 6 people I need to hire 3 chef and bartender. But then can anyone explain me, why we have 6 tables at first hotel then? They are useless, because we can't service, only 6 people at once, other customers leave in anger the place and the hotel too even if 3 tables empty. This limit is worst idea ever in a game!",2,6,1.9.8
Edward Farrar,The game its self is fine however it is literally unplayable without watching an advert every single minute you play or you play for weeks to complete a level that normally would take a few days So the game literally forces you too watch hundreds of adverts a day in order too make it even remotely worthwhile playing. Clearly shows the greed of the company that produced the game is all about their financial gain. And the endless amounts of adverts make the game not worth playing as its too much.,1,6,1.7.1
Dev A,It's of course a good game. I like simulator games more than RPGs. And the low rating is because the game crashes when we open an Ad. Really very annoying.,1,6,1.8.4
A Google user,Why make more hotels of you can't get 5 stars on the second one? I have upgraded literally everything and it still wont go past 4 stars. I cant unlock any more hotels because I would need 3 five star hotels. I wasted some money on this game but never again. Second game from the same people with the same people. Just sad.7,1,6,1.7.1
Madilynn Oneil,"This is a very good game. But the only thing that I don't like about it, is that when the V.I.P costumer comes and offers you alot of money, and then when you watch the video it never gives you the money but, other then that, This is a very good game. If you have time please fix. Thank you.",4,6,1.9.93
RanjithKumar Katta,"So the problem with this game is the hotel charges you more than the customers pay you (at least 1st 24hours of your gameplay) no matter what do, you get paid a max of $10 & a simple basic upgrade costs you min of $150. So, how anyone plays this game unless the player has 24 hours % collects every penny, I felt dumb. And ads, each ad is 30+ seconds with an extra 10-15+ seconds & a total of 1 mint ad, really? And this game exact version of Jail Tycoon and it's far entertaining and playable.",1,6,1.9.7
Troy Waistell,Really fun game and incredibly addictive! I just wish they would create more hotels for me to complete that aren't time limited. I'm on my last hotel so I'll delete the game once I have finished. But defo worth the time to play! Thanks for a fun ride!!,5,6,1.9.97
A Google user,"I think this game is beautiful, and absolutely amazing. I play it all the time, and really I only wish that there were more hotels and that it wasn't so hard to start off a new hotel to the point it takes days to get it to make real money. But I don't really care, it's still a really fun game that I'd totally recommend.",5,6,1.2.2
Paramraj Singh,"This game is one of the most realistic games I've ever played. It's much more than just an idle game, because it takes some serious thinking and strategies to play and be successful. I'm also happy with the fact that no ads randomnly pop up, making the game more enjoyable. Good work Codigames, I'm a fan of your other games too!",5,6,1.8.3
Austin Thomas,"Much like the rest of Codi games idlers this game doesn't work properly, people get mad and walk out of the kitchen or bars due to high wait times even with full staff and upgrades. The store is just outlandish I mean 10.99$ to remove ads? The entire game isn't even worth that much let alone just an ad removal purchase. You have games like dead cells out there that are actual games brought from pc and consol that are cheaper than that. Great job at adding another crummy game to the list of GP.",1,6,1.7.3
Tuyul Sakti,"When I played the second hotel, the ad king doesn't come anymore, making the progress really hard and I'm losing the money. I really want to buy free ads buff but if the ad king doesn't come, what the purpose of purchasing the buff then?",3,6,1.9.91
Paul Lewis,"These people make crappy games that don't work and then walk away from providing ANY support. This one is no different. Devs like this are interested only in greed. They replicate games that are excessively ad based then walk away from providing any support so they can create another. Ads here are longest of any game, over 40 seconds.

A Google user,"I have played all the Codigames idle tycoon games and loved them, this one is bulls**t. You never get enough money to buy ANYTHING unless you watch a butt load of ads... But guess what, you STILL don't have any money. Something's screwed with the payouts, spend $300 for a $3 rate increase, that's not $3/hr, that's $3/night, so enjoy waiting 100 f***ing DAYS to see a return on that investment. FIX YOUR GAME",1,6,1.7.1
Rumah No.8,I love this game so much and the game have more hotel but I still level 1 because I just played xd. BTW the game have a little bit lag. Well the game is really fun but the hotel have a sound like __ and shower and coocing and TV but it's ok.,5,6,1.9.93
DoomGuy Slayer,This game is great but my connection is bad and i cant disbale claim rewards and make it another offline version of it so i can play it when lights went out.,4,6,

otipro083,Very much to do! Best game ever!,5,6,1.7.3
A Google user,I simultaneously enjoy this game and am frustrated by it. I love the game's art and animation. The characters are cute and their animations are very detailed. The guests could really use some refinement. It seems as though guest movement and timing was created specifically for the first hotel and the next hotels they don't work well for. I bought the no ads add-on because I was enjoying the game but if I hadn't I don't think I would be able to commit to the time to get money to complete.,3,5,1.2.0
A Google user,"It's a pretty solid game. Good for taking breaks in between studying. Has a good sense of pace in the first hotel. I didn't breeze through but I didn't feel like I needed to watch for ads to get by. The controls are a little goofy. I feel like when I want to click things I click the wrong room or it takes me somewhere else. Not game breaking by any means, just a little inconvenient.",4,5,1.4.0
A Google user,"A simple game with a nice appearance, but nothing truly engaging or worthwhile. I played the game to its current end (complete Arabian) and enjoyed it for three most part. The graphics are simple and cute; and utter feels nice to see everything come together. However it's flooded with ads, once a hotel is complete it serves no purpose, and there's never any challenge or difficult objective. TL:DR, the game is nice for a basic casual gameplay but beyond that isn't worth spending money on.",3,5,1.3.1
A Google user,"I enjoy the game, but I feel as though a couple things could be improved upon. First, being able to transfer money between hotels would be nice. I have fully upgraded all I can in the first hotel, but now the profit I earn there is just sitting there unused while I'm struggling to improve the next hotel. Second, while I know app developers could use the money, $10.99 to unlock a special character is a bit too expensive for me. Other than that, I'd say this is a great little game!",3,5,1.3.1
Jac Alon,"Nice graphics, love the upgrade structure. Definitely felt that the ad removal purchase was worth it. Feedback: In blue crystal resort Suite, the Climate Control and Decor overlap each other. You do see bugs sometimes with the guests and surrounding furniture, but this seems like more of an overlooked feature. Suggestion: To be able to provide user feedback through the game.",5,5,1.7.3
A Google user,"The game is fun, but I feel like it takes a long time to make money. It's a lot of just... waiting. The other problem is the optional upgrades you pay real money for is REALLY overpriced. Most games just charge a couple dollars to remove ads. This one asks for over $10. Not worth removing ads. But the game itself is fun.",3,5,1.7.1
A Google user,"The game is pretty fun, ads aren't intrusive, but they do seem necessary to generate a decent amount of money. At least that is my experience so far. I just started yesterday though. Other than the need to use the ads for income, everything else is pretty fun. Whimsical graphics, reasonable controls, and a decent payoff in the end.",4,5,1.2.1
A Google user,"The concept is great but the amount of ads to 2x and accomplish any task with speed is ridiculous. To accumulate cash quick you can watch ads, which is great IF THEY WORK. Oh, logging back in you can 2x your profit...but you have to watch an ad again...AND IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK. Super glitchy. Need to increase what you can do without ads and fix the ads so they play if someone wants to use those bonuses.",2,5,1.2.0
A Google user,"I love your guy's tycoon games! Keep making them! My only problem in this game is that its SUPER hard to afford anything without watching a bunch of ads. I leveled to the next hotel and barely get anything from the ""ad guy"". In the other games you were able to get more money when you leveled up to the next store or whatever. Really fun game though.",5,5,1.1.1
A Google user,"Actually a pretty fun game. I'm noticing a lot of people glossing over the fact that this is an IDLE game, where you don't just speed through and you benefit from checking in on the game every few hours rather than playing nonstop. Honestly the game can be played to completion with no ads, however I often watch ads for bonuses because I can choose when to watch these ads. Most games are riddled with ads and paywalls, but this one is pretty great",4,5,1.3.0
A Google user,"It was fun at first, I like the controls and it was overall pretty great for a beginner. But then you needed to earn money, and the add would freeze and never play to the end so you couldn't really get ahead at all. Until the ads are fixed I would recommend staying away from this game.",2,5,1.2.0
Dan Eagen,"Pretty good game! The dev updated it and added a few new hotels, which are larger and have more things to do. The scheduling is wonky, the people walk too slow (90 minutes to walk from the front desk to your hotel room?) And the events are impossible unless you buy the package, but its still a fun game.",4,5,1.7.2
A Google user,"It's a pretty cool game. It's a lot harder to earn money than the other tycoons I've played before though, still not sure if that's good or bad. One thing that need work on is when the guy in the golden guy comes up and dances for, I try to press the watch video button but it exes me out of it like I pressed the no thanks button. And almost every single time the Mades go out to do the cleaning one of them gets stuck in the first master bedroom. To fix it I have to completely ex out of the game.",4,5,1.2.0
Brent Richards,"Best video ad watching app ever! No, seriously. If you hate it when silly games get in the way of watching your favorite ads, then this is the game for you! Update: just played my first event. Probably watched 200 ads to gain as much profit as possible and played virtually non stop other than sleeping and couldn't even get 1 out of 3 stars. Uninstalled.",1,5,1.7.1
Emanuel Paul,"My second playthrough, but it's just as an awesome experience as it was the first time. There are plenty of ads involved but they're not intrusive at all; they can actually be really helpful. Also you don't have to pay to complete a hotel and also, in my opinion, you don't have to grind endlessly to progress. Sure it may not be the most challenging game, given the fact that there are no grave consequences if you mismanage the hotels, but overall it's really entertaining. Just my opinion.",5,5,2.8
Emilia K,"The ads, for me, have stopped working? The ones that you watch so that you get a x2 on money. It also started to bore me more as it takes a long time to upgrade certain things, unless you pay or watch ads (that don't work for me) Another thing is the daily rewads thing when you log in, it doesn't actually give it to me.",3,5,2.9
Richo Richards,"This is, the slowest most boring game I have played, even after spending a good $60 on the thing, it is still slow as, and soooo boring, way too hard to make money and upgrades are expensive, thought once I spent a bit of money on it it would be fun, but alas still boring and slow, it's a shame because the game has A LOT of potential, but as usual, greedy pigs ruin everything.",1,5,2.9
Laura Trotter,"Fun until hotel three...Like other people mentioned the ads stop working and the investor guy doesn't appear anymore. I really enjoyed it and tried it because I play this company's other games. Apparently, they can't get this one to work, nor do they care if other people have reported the same issue and it hasn't been fixed. I just uninstalled the game, not worth me investing money in I guess if no one wants to keep it up.",3,5,2.9
Allen Osborn,Ads won't load. And before you would sometimes get a bug where they don't reward you. I'm due 44k lol.,3,5,3
A Google user,"Been playing for a few days and this been great. I did pay for a few of the upgrades, which I totally find worth it. It keeps me checking and busy over time. Great game so far! Just unlocked my second hotel. The only downside I see so far is that once you fully upgrade a hotel, it still collects money but there isn't anything to do. No extra challenge to make sure the hotel is running properly.",4,5,1.2.0
A Google user,"It's a really nice game to past time, I did buy the dog upgrade which I would recommend otherwise you need to watch 100s of ads. But its normally 10 pound but they do discounts alot on events. One thing that bugs me is you cant use your money from previous hotels?? Once a hotel is fully upgraded it earns money for nothing really. So would be helpful to use it in other hotels. Otherwise it does take a long time to get running. Also there needs to be more lighting outside of a night.",4,5,1.7.1
Liam Bush,"Leaving my review again as my last one has deleted for some reason. I've played this game for a really long time. I unlocked the final hotel around a week ago but my balance keeps resetting to zero every time I try to play. I have kept the game open for a long time and clicked on the cash bonuses as they come in order to build the money up as much as i can, but it still resets to zero once I leave. Will change my rating to 5 stars if this is fixed",3,5,1.7.3
A Google user,This game is fantastic absolutly no reason not to play it. Very realistic as what the costumers do not a lot of ads. The only problem I have with this game that I opened the Stanley Resort and took care of both hotels when I went back to the first hotel it restarted it like a rebirth so I bought all the rooms and upgrades and now it's gone. Somebody please explain this.,4,5,1.1.1
Scott Ogeen,Love game it's easy still challenging to play ready for more hotels need more hotels should be a way to earn the diamonds better like 5 a day when you play that day when is there going to be new hotel to play with out event time when will there be more hotels,5,5,2.9
A Google user,Great game but a few issues. I love this game but I lost a lot of progress tonight. Its a shame that once you finish a hotel you can go back but can't do anything with profits. The amount of energy needed for some things is too high. Also the cost of removing ads is too high. If it was a quarter of the price I would consider it. Overall though it will be great if they can fix these issues.,3,5,1.0
A Google user,Loved this game so much I actually made one of the in app purchases that stops you having to watch ads. I played it for weeks on end but after completing the first 'event hotel' with 1 star I actually got kinda bored of it and realised it is quite repetitive. However I completed 4 of the regular hotel and had an attempt at a few event hotels before I got to the boredom point. It's a fun game to play on lunch breaks or if you have 10 minutes here or there to just take you mind off other things.,4,5,1.7.1
Jessica Shipley,"The game itself is probably worth 4 stars. It's much more involved than most idle games, with a few minor glitches and occasional poor guest path issues. The big flaw to the game is that it's virtually unplayable without spending $15 to remove ads, and then it still tries to gouge you for other purchases. I took two stars off for that... Then added one back because I did pay the $15 and am still playing it lol.",3,5,1.8.2
A Google user,"Only had the game a few days and so far i love it, can't get off it. I like the way you can watch ads to build your money up and to double the money when you select the ad for 2 hours. The guests do keep having something above their head which i don't know what it means and it won't let me click on it but so far so good.",5,5,1.1.1
A Google user,I enjoyed the game and would rate the game a 5 star. my reason is due to every now and then my save file would reset itself to default and then I'd lose all what I had gain/ achieved. after reading other reviews it looks like this is a common bug that has developed during early stages of development. keep up the good work I can't wait for the game to get better.,3,5,0.1.1
Lauz,"This looked cute and ran well but from the start I couldn't break even. I played for about 10 minutes, then opened it back up in the morning to find all my expenses had gone well beyond my revenue overnight. I followed the tutorial steps but from the get go, I couldn't earn enough money to expand or even keep my 1 chef hired. I'm not interested in a mobile game that's challenging from the very start, it's much better to be eased into it and then slowly increase difficulty",2,5,
A Google user,"Need to watch loads of ads to progress anywhere. Bundles are expensive, game glitchy. I can have an empty hotel and front desk tell people it is full. Staff quit even though there is enough money to pay them. Would be better if you had a list of objectives for each area, or bar, bedroom etc. Not just 3 at a time. Electricity needs addressing as pretty ,much everything uses it. A telephone using as much as a TV or a Hoover?",2,5,1.6.0
A Google user,"I enjoyed this game to begin with but it gets boring very quickly. Once a hotel hits 5 stars, there are no additional challenges or actions so you just move in and do the same thing with another hotel, quite repetitive.

A Google user,"Dissappointed. I've had a few of these games now and usually I'd I like them I'll pop a few quid in to them to buy the upgrades. On this occasion I bought the upgrade that let's you keep the hotel open 10 hours. It worked for the first 2 but now I'm on hotel 3 my hotel closes after about 30 minutes. Not had a problem before, so the 2 stars is because the ONE thing you probably shouldn't get wrong is ANYTHING Monetized!",2,5,1.2.1
SPHYNXXXZZZ,It's not the best game....you dont make money that fast and most of the time you have to watch an ad to make money..its very over priced for keeping the chef's and maids and half of the time I waste my money on keeping them cause they keep leaving due to me not having enough money to pay them! And it takes the maids a while just to go up and clean on the next day...I have a lot more things I dont like but there is a few...3 star..sorry! __,3,5,1.7.1

Dont bother downloading until they fix.",1,5,1.3.1
The Erikin84,"After going through a good chunk, I'd say it's alright. But what hurts it is the single use event buyouts for things like the presidential suites during the weekly events. You have to pay 10$ a week if you want to have a chance at maxing out your earning each week, more or less turning this into a pseudo subscription. It's a shame, I wanted to like this game, but the price gouging killed it for me. If things like the event stuff was a one time purchase, id be more forgiving, but $10 a week?",2,5,1.7.1
A Google user,"Love this game! The only reason i gave 3 stars is because the only way to progress is watch ad after ad or pay the $$ (which i did.) Its way to expensive.

DedCorpInc. (Lexi),"Compared to other idle games I have played, this game is not jam packed with ads nor does it fill the screen with 'watch a video for a bonus' notifications.

A Google user,"Great game, very addictive. Yes there is a few glitches, people getting stuck, for example. But overall a great game. Can't wait for an update for a new hotel.

A Google user,My husband and I both installed this game at the same time! He has no problems at all watching the ads however for some reason my game will not let me watch the ads . Very frustrating.

A Google user,"Its a good entertaining game, but it does get boring since its so hard to get money after you enter a new hotle such as the events or the crystal resort,(i think thats what its called) the third hotel. Another thing that is REALLY fustrating is when you come back after 2 hours and want to double profits, you watch an ad. For me, it works a bit but then somtimes it will play 2 ads instead and then crash the app, please fix cuz i hate ads.",3,5,1.6.0
A Google user,I love the game and I think watching the ads on exchange for some extra deeds is weighed out nicely. Or the small fee to get that eliminated quickly isn't bad either. I appreciate a good casual idle game with my lifestyle. My only problem is after you fully finish a hotel and start a new one you should at least get some revenue from it while starting another hotel otherwise it's just sitting there unplayed making money. Pls give us some revenue checks,4,5,1.4.0
A Google user,"Utter Garbage So the game starts off pretty ok, very very slow but ok. Then comes the ultimate grindfest, spend a ton of cash or watch ads all day! 20 ads to get a two hours income bonus. What the heck! Then it gets even worse.

A Google user,"I really like this game which is really unusual because I'm not really fond about idle games but I do like this one. If I may I would really like to make a suggestion, the game is really slow on making money and the electric objects in it takes to much power on some of them, so I would just suggest maybe improving it a little bit on those areas.",4,5,1.4.2
A Google user,Great game! Very addicting. There are five basic things that I look for in a game. 1) Fun/Keep my attention. 2) Not PvP. 3) Not Pay to Play or Advance. 4) Game time longer than ad frequency. 5) Can move to SD card. This meets my 5 points. This game has an Fair balance of ads / playtime in my opinion and it's far better watching an ad than having to spend my money to level up. If you dont want ads go out and purchase games! Game devs deserve pay to entertain us and ads do just that.,5,5,1.4.4
A Google user,"Really fun game, however the paywall behind 5 starring a location is ridiculous. I'm on the second hotel, and can't progress because I need 5 stars to unlock the next location. However I have purchased literally every available upgrade that doesn't require gems, however I'm still no where near 5 stars. So the only way to progress the game is to buy gems with real money. This is greedy and selfish, and completely killed all love I had for this game. Thanks for the fun 2 weeks, but deleting now__",1,5,1.2.0
neil farynowski,The game is fun and all but you should be able to carry over your income from hotels you've finished into new hotels. This would be how building a hotel empire would actually be.

Angi Jenkins (Tigrane),"I really enjoyed this game because of the challenges and finding new ways to optimize my build, but for the last 3 challenges, my resort is still built and earning money while away, giving me nothing to do for the challenge except earn money.

sammy-jo Nardolilli,Can take a while to get to where you need as your progress but it's literally the only game I play so its definitely good lol. I like that you dont have to buy gems you earn them which is so much better. The literal only thing I've paid for is 2x income without adverts for ¡ê4.50 that's all nothing else is required unlike other games. Definitely a winner.,5,5,1.7.3
Muhammad Kelvin,"The game is pretty decent. But please make an option to make the time faster like 2x or even 4x. Because it's just too long to wait. And there's too many ways that lead the player to buy the ""no ads"" and that kind of thing man",3,5,1.8.4

A Google user,"So far, I am loving this game. Unlike most Idle Tycoons I've played, it doesn't generate $1M just overnight thus giving a bit more difficulty. I appreciate the mechanics of the employees and electricity as it adds a bit of management in the gameplay.

Levi Matthews,"Stanley Hotel: x2 doesn't work. Gold car does not show up. Maids will not clean rooms. Instant clean just cycles, just like x2. No support. Not everyone does Twitter or Facebook. Nothing works to fix this. Please help. I want to play and purchase but not if this game doesn't work. So sad. It's fun. Please fix bugs.",1,5,1.9.91
Peter Berton,So far so good. The ads and freedom of gameplay are balanced. This type of game does not have to commit too much. Like can play whenever you have free time. Though could increase the idle time rather than 2 hours only. Thank you,5,5,1.8.1
Rae Allen,"Disappointing game in the end, can only play for 2 hotels then theres nothing you can do to progress too the next hotel.  I also did the event hotel, played from the moment it opened to the day it closed (4 days total) and still didn't reach the 1 star goal mark which was really infuriating.  Your game sucks, you have to be able to progress without micro transactions and even when I spent all my 300 gems in one hotel I still couldn't progress from 4 star to open the 3rd hotel. Too pay to win",1,5,1.7.2
jarod berndt,"Just like many others are saying, the game no longer works. For me however, the game half works. I am currently at 29/35 stars, with the imperator at 4/5 and just recently started the medival hotel. Upon closing the app last night, I worked on the imperator last, and this morning it loaded for me. However, when I went to work on the medival hotel, it was then that the game couldn't load the hotel. It may be that something about everyone's final hotels have stopped working?",3,5,1.8.4
A Google user,"Very fun but theres one issue. You should make it so we can take at least a little of the money from previous hotels to get the next one started. Im on the beach hotel and its really hard to advance quickly because you want $55,000 to build one room. I know buying the corgi will make it quicker but i dont have the money for that right now. So either give us more money to start hotels or make the vip prices go up more. Then i will gladly give you 5 stars",4,5,1.7.1

Developers if you are interested in improving your game, the only thing i wish i could do is use my money as a whole and not seperately for each hotel because right now i just opened my second hotel and i am having a hard time imroving while in my first hotel i have 50,000 cash with nothing to do because i did everything and there is no way to spend that money.",4,5,1.2.0

Hasti Cheraghchi,It WAS a good game. If i needed money i could watch ads. But now the ad doesn't play and then the screen freezes and i have to reopen the game. But its so addictive and fun I would give 5 stars if there wasn't the ad problem,3,5,1.9.7
Jordan Morris,"This game would be rather decent if not for the forced ads. The constant ad pushing every 30 secs or so that gets old, but the back breaker is that the game will knee cap you by locking rooms in your hotel and requiring an ad to unlock the room. Therefore you can expect to watch ads for no benefit, just to keep the idle game running.",1,5,1.7.3
Louis Butler,"Really fun and addictive! This game reminds me of a mix between The Sims and the old classic Sim Tower, both games are beloved by me, so if you like games like those this app will hit the spot for your entertainment. For me this game is worth all their in app purchases, I've spent more on console games that were sub par to this game. Plus I get a kick out of finding all the movie characters staying at my hotel such as John Wick, Beatrice from Kill Bill and others lol . Quite entertaining!!",5,5,1.7.1

Then i tried downloading another tycoon app that you guys didnt make but immediately deleted it, not as good as your apps.

I definatly recomend giving it a try!____,5,5,1.8.4
Sophia Wong,The game was good but it was too many ads like I need to watch every ads to earn more money. Sometimes the ads video can't load. And I think it would be more fun if the game was in horizontal mode.,2,5,1.9.91
A Google user,"The game would be much better if it could show more details on the customer. Details such as names, age, occupation, relationship, duration and reason of staying could be add to make the player feel more engage. Also when the customer want to checkout, maybe the customer can give a review about his/her staying in the hotel. Like how good/bad is the food, the room, etc. Also how much days or money the customer had spent on his/her stay. Overall, it was a good game.",4,5,1.2.0
A Google user,"Updating: since customer support refuses to address the problems of this game, I'm lowering rating to 1 stars Ads in this game dont work which means making money is slow.

If you can't fix this why in the world would I spend my real money on your game?!",1,5,1.3.1
A Google user,"After reading others, I decided to make a reply as my review is already reflected. THIS IS AN IDLE GAME!! People complaining about making money takes too long, or the opposite, they beat the game too fast.. put your phone down for a few hours every once in a while. That's what the IDLE part means. Agree events are worthless to try for, money should be able to be transferred from finished hotels, and service staff should serve more than 2 at a time. Otherwise absolutely great game.

A Google user,I love this game but i had to give it one star cuz it started cheating me out of money and diamonds. When the guy shows up in the car you push the button to watch a video for more money it won't give it to you. As for task you earn diamonds i've done it says sorry try again later and no diamonds on some tasks. Another its to much money to build room by room and then to top it off fix the rooms up even higher geez. It starts you off with hardly any money. How do you expect to do that w/o $$$,1,5,1.5.0
A Google user,"dear Developers, you have done something marvelous. You have taken my favorite game idle market and perfected into this beautiful Masterpiece. Not only that you improve upon your ground, but you didn't fix anything that wasn't broken. You also did something that in the other game bothered me, there was no risk! But now there is! And I'm very happy to see that these developers know what they're doing.",5,5,1.3.0
A Google user,"I enjoy this a lot. However, I feel like the money should all go into one account. Cause once I finish 1 hotel, I cant do anything with it anymore. It makes money, but I cant use that money to improve my other hotels. One more thing is that the cleaning service is too slow. I already hired all the possible personnel (that tends to 0 ppl, btw) upgraded all the equipments but rooms still dont get cleaned?

A Google user,"Game was fun, but little bit dissapoint about the last hotel. I'm just thinking the last hotel more bigger and complex than 3rd hotel. Maybe you can expand the game for more fun. Note : For player who say cant get 5 star without using real money, I can say u are noob. Coz if u spend your gems just for 3x money, thats was your fault. I spend gems bonuses just for 1 special item each service. Max all facilities then 5 stars just appears. Dont blame if you cant manage well.",4,5,1.2.1
A Google user,The first thing that annoy me is the game force you to buy/build something if I have enough money. Even at the start the game you force us to hire a chef and do advertising. After playing awhile I realized I dont need them in early game because they make me loss money. Just do the explanation and let us decide to hire/buy/build them. The other one is there is no faq/help section in the game. I dont even know that one chef only serve two people at first. That make customer angry and leave.,3,5,1.2.0

In Stanley resort, upgraded house keeping to 100% and hired maximum staffs. But, they are not cleaning all the rooms. 3. Front desk service should be 24*7.",4,5,1.7.1

I mean if you put somone who gives you money for free in a game when you don't get the money it's VERY frustrating.

xcopper69 coleman,"Yes, there are alot of ads for those of us who choose not to pay for the privilege of internet games. That being said, and understanding that ads are forever, the game's sequence is true to life, the graphics are excellent. If you think running a hotel is easy (picky, whiney, bitchy guests and all) you might want to try this game first before taking the plunge. I enjoyed every minute and couldn't wait to return to it. It's as close as ""close"" can be without getting run over. Great game.",5,4,
Laura Bieber,"Overall, a lot of fun. I'm working on finishing out my last hotel. But I do wish that it was balanced in such a way that you could work on more than one hotel at once. Sure you can go back to them and collect money but that serves no point to furthering your game progress. You have to fully max one to move on to the next and especially at the beginning, the slow grind nearly made me uninstall.",4,4,1.7.2
Murashka S,"Started as a great game. Good general concept, draws you in, love that you can watch ads to get extra stuff. Uninstalled because, #1, after you finish a hotel, you can't use the money it accrues I'm any way. It just sits there. Money piling up like dust. That was the biggest turnoff. Made me lose interest in even finishing the next one. #2, the glitches are bad. Otherwise, I'd still be playing. Sad.",2,4,

Other than that, it's fun once you build up your money. :]",4,4,1.2.0
Dayna Abel,"I have a lot of fun with this game, but I also have suggestions for improvement: -More variety in the Event hotels. Since there's no option to erase your progress and start over, you could use the existing hotel structures and randomize them for use in Events. -In-game achievements. -The option to erase your progress and start over (for hotels only - cash purchases for ad removal and such should remain).

A Google user,I could have been a 5 star because it was exactly the kind of game I was looking for. The kind I could let run while at work and just check it from time to time. My only problem is that if you buy the upgrade for the manager who collects while you're letting it run in the background you can finish the game too quickly and get maxed out all the hotels and there's nothing left to do.

Nick Prater,"I really enjoy this game. It's fun and rewarding. I wish, however, that you could customize your hotels.

I'd rate it higher if either of these things were addressed.",3,4,1.7.3
A Google user,"Fun, but felt short. I completed all of the hotels within 1-2 weeks. (But then again, I did pay for the game being ad-free because of the awesome bonus from the ""dancing King."")

I'm here to ask the developers if they could fix the lag after upgrading stuff. It freezes my game for couple of seconds each time I upgrade something. It seems to get stronger with every new hotel, and it just makes me feel like not even bothering to play anymore. That's it. It's the only thing that I find extremely annoying about this game I wish it could be fixed",5,4,1.3.1

Can you please make an option to reset BUT you can customize your own hotel, add as many rooms, add as many pools etc. Sandbox mode, no limits!!! Because right now there is nothing to do, and I'm going to delete it soon.",3,4,1.2.1
TheCoolerWaffles,"This game is amazing and the graphics are awesome. The only downside is that every time you move to a new hotel, you have no money and have to watch all the videos again. Plus, I was so annoyed with having to watch ads to get money, that in the end I bought no ads but you still get the rewards. I was eventually bored of it though and deleted it but I have downloaded it again. Luckily it saved my progress. I would definitely download this game if you are bored and have nothing else to do.",4,4,1.7.2
A Google user,"I've really loved playing this game since getting it _ very satisfying and it doesn't rely on microtransactions. The reason I'm changing from 5* to 3* now is because of a new ad in those you watch for dancing man/instant customers/+10mins to 2¡Á profit _ since it's free to play, I watch the ads without complaint (I'd pay for no ads if it wasn't kinda extortionate), but the new solitaire ad is what, 1 minute+ long each time? Finding it very off-putting. Way too long to watch so many of them.",3,4,1.5.0
A Google user,"Great concept, but if you want to progress you'll have to watch circa 20-30 ads an hour minimum or pay ¡ê10+(!) It should be easier to upgrade and not so ad dependant, because if you don't watch ads it would be an extremely slow and boring game. Also, you can't carry money over from hotels!",3,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"Playing for about three days, I do enjoy the game but there is definitely a lot of improvement that can follow into this game. Like gems should be able to convert to cash would be a nice feature, achievements added to this game would be nice. I get a small glitch where the front desk is facing away from the guest when checking in and out. Game is based on watching ads if you want to complete the Hotel faster, if you want the ads gone you have to pay a big amount to remove them.",3,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"The events are absolute garbage. Can't place without spending money, lowest tier reward if you DO shell out the $11 they want for it. Not actually a terrible game aside from the necessity to watch ads to progress, or else drop $11 to get rewards without having to waste the time on it, but between the garbage events and the garbage ad grabs, they get 1* from me.",1,4,1.7.1
A Google user,if u spent as much time making the game as advertising it would be good. I like these kind of games and thought it would be fun to try this out. Well I download it and let me tell ya its impossible to play with these ads I played it for probably 2 hours with ads before I said f*** it and paid the 11 dollars to play without ads. It also had some other perks to it but not worth 11 dollars but I was like theres four hotels I will get to play awhile. WRONG I got 2 hotels and 8 hours game play.,1,4,1.2.0
GWEN,"Game play is good only if when watching an ad for an investor, you actually collect! They are not giving anything although you are watching the ad. 5/7/20 This is a very good and entertaining game, except most of our time is spent watching ads in order to have a great hotel! If we received more by watching an ad it would definitely be a greater incentive!",3,4,1.7.1
Dwarlord,"Fun enough game. However, the $10 charge to remove ads to obtain the games currency , or rather enough of the games currency to make the game fun is problematic. Or you can watch an add every 30 seconds for that same currency. I must say I would pay to remove the ads but after making it to hotel 3 the game would no longer open without an uninstall and reinstall losing all my progress. Already being hesitant with the cost of $10 to remove the ads, I'm unwilling to spend on a game that is unstable",3,4,1.8.4
Overhaul,What's the point in he even having a game on your phone if it doesn't even load up past the menu. For all the time I did play it it was amazing it was really fun but after a week or two it's stopped loading up whatsoever if you want to play this game you need to play it fast but I may warn you there's a very high chance of it never loading up again,1,4,1.8.4
A Google user,So i don't usually play any games on mobile apart from cod or pubg (which i also left ) . This game is good for killing time . I would have rated it 5 stars if it was more interactive and less based on ads. I would also like the funds to be transferable to another hotel . For instance if one of my hotel is fully upgraded then i could use those funds to develop other hotels.,4,4,1.2.0
Cecibell Lowe,"So far so good, the tutorial isn't super long and the graphics are cute. The spreadsheets are also quite nifty as well, switching between rooms took a moment to get used to but altogether, everything feels pretty intuitive. Keep it up!",4,4,1.9.93
Meaghan Smiths,Starting to get annoyed! I get asked to write to them in the game support and I said I can't because the game crashes every time! Never heard back I enjoy these games but seriously this game and the prison one keep crashing every time you get a few minutes if your lucky and I mean 2-3 or less. That's why I won't download anymore codigames or spend money as I have and it was a waste.,3,4,2.0
A Google user,You have to watch adds to get anywhere in the game. There are also bugs while upgrading you can get stuck on that screen and have to force the program to close. If you want to switch between hotel expect to loose half your guests or with a hard shutdown of the game due to a bug.,2,4,1.3.0
Skitzweasel,Just paid for the booster pack 3 times because it said failed each time but was charged for each one. Your support email on here doesn't work and if there is a link in the app; it's hard to find. Absolute rip off and seems like you're trying to steal. I have emailed your support email from your website but no response 6 hours later.,1,4,1.8.2
Dayne Riche,"I love this game a lot, except there are a few bugs that deter me for a while. The video ads hardly ever work lately. For double profit or for the VIP extra money. It's annoying because making money is a slow process when just beginning without the extras. Please fix for 5 stars!",4,4,1.8.4
james walter,The reason why I gave this 3 stars is because the game is a good game to pass time but you have to watch a lots of ads to succeed. Every time you unlock new hotel you start of with 50k but that's not enough If I'm on my 4 hotel because upgrades be like 50k. So I prefer if you add more money for start off. Before you go saying oh the ads help no they don't. The ads be like $600 to $1k. Sometimes you watch a ad and don't receive nothing. So respond this.,3,4,1.9.7
A Google user,"I like the ability to start and maintain various hotels. At first, you earn money slowly, but as you continue to invest money in upgrades, the income per day (24 minutes) increases. You can get more money faster by getting money from an investor that occasionally walks into the hotel. All you have to do is click the investor (who dances in the lobby) and watch videos. The downside is that the video doesn't always play and you forfeit the money.",3,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"Has a lot of potential, but it pushes players to view ads constantly right off the bat. Operating costs are pretty cool for an idle game. Just 5 mins in, I see without viewing ads progress is ridiculously slow. Passive income is a joke because of the gap between playing the game normally and clicking on one of the ads that come up every 10 seconds. Theres no income on nights, so skip with ad. Maids dont actually clean? Clean with an ad. Abysmal passive income? Ad.",2,4,1.1.1
A Google user,Nothing is more annoying than a game pushing adds to get money when they release such a broken game. The people don't stick to routine while you're away. The maids literally lie facedown on the couches. Pay for adds while you're away and the hotel isnt full. The watch an add to double your profits upon returning to the game doesn't work. Gems are expected to transfer to other hotels but funds aren't transferable. There's so much more but this is baseline to work on.,2,4,1.2.1
A Google user,"Way too simplistic. There's nothing more to do than to wait for money to tick in so that you can by the next minor upgrade. Also, it seems a lot of effort has been put in to mechanics for ad revenue and monetization which only gets in the way of game play. Promising game, but destroyed by its poor focus.",2,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"Don't get this. It's fun for the first 10 minutes, but after that it is pretty much just a game for watching ads. It would take you FOREVER to do anything without watchind ads. Also if you exit and don't play for even a small time the hotel ""closes"" and you don't earn anything.",1,4,1.3.1
Sonja Selby,"I use to love this game, but the issues make it less fun to play. I use to be able to play the events for hours! Now I have to back out and reload the game every so often because the videp rewards stop paying out after a few times. It is very frustrating! If you fix this than I will give a way better rating!",1,4,1.7.2
Comet the Night Fury,"It's a good game, good for when you only need half your attention on it. My only real complaint is that when I click on the Dancing Guy, he doesn't usually give me cash, which really started annoying me after a while. If you could fix this so that I actually get money for watching ads, then that would be great. Thank you!",4,4,1.7.1
A Google user,Love the game! It's very addictive but the income is hard to get. I'm on my third hotel and everything is so expensive to upgrade especially compared to the income you get. You have to watch videos a lot to get more money but that's more than fine with me! It's a free great game and the makers need to get paid too!,4,4,1.2.0
A Google user,Basically this game requires players to spend REAL money. I've experienced lots of bugs and reported to the developer.. to unlock 3rd Hotel Location 9 stars are required.. and you will need to fully upgrade one hotel to 5 stars.. for me I dont have enough diamonds (even after finishing all quests) to upgrade it.. I refuse to spend REAL money.. Totally unbalanced gaming by requiring players to watch ads to progress further faster because this game pace is way too slow..,1,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"After the tutorial, I went out to complete quests as suggested. Seem to always lose more than I can make in profit never to make any progress when I get back to the game. No interest in coming back to something that makes me feel like I shouldn't play it in the first place.",1,4,1.2.0
A Google user,This game is so glitchy. I want profits to increase 3 times but it doesn't work. It doesn't even give me the money. Even now I just logged in and I dont even get a thousand. It is a good game to pass the time but my suggestion if you download the game which I highly recommend you do is that always ask the dancing king for money and when logging back in after 2 hours is that never press profits x3 or profits x2 if you want to get the money you collected from that 2hrs. This is what happened to me,3,4,1.3.1
A Google user,I didnt have to spend my lifes savings to play this game and it's really fun! I dont mind the ads I'll watch as many as they put in there so I can keep playing without paying. Yes there are paid options in the game but you can still have fun without them. Perfect for long trips and parties you feel awkward at lol.,5,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"This is a very nice game for time killing and specially the concept of the game is superb.! Just a thing to improve is about ads. In between the game it feels like a player is watching only ads. So, there should be equal balance of all these things.. Thanks..!",5,4,1.5.0
A Google user,"I'll give it a 4 stars so that you consider making it even better . The game is awesome but maybe there are some stuff you can add for a better experience : - you can add mantainance to the finished hotels , we have a lot of money but we can't use it anywhere and without maintenance the game will come to an end with finishing the last hotel possible - you can add more manager options such as configuring service hours or work hours for the employees The game is awesome keep going __",4,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"I tried to email the help center, but I received a response saying it doesn't exist. There's no incentive to return to 5star hotels and there are no rewards for finishing a hotel. Why are there only 16 parking spaces for a bar, spa, ski slopes, and restaurant? People can't park, so they can't visit? Cute graphics! When I finish all hotels, then what? It's over, just delete the game? Why are there no GooglePlay achievements? The game info is misleading and exaggerating.",3,4,1.2.0
Nathan French,"Fun game so far, and it's and good time killer. Will recommend it if you like to play games that you improve stuff but dont have to watch alot of vids or play a matching game. I did pay for no ads and it is definitely worth it. It made the game so much better. One time charge and I have yet to watch a video or any.",4,4,1.7.2
A Google user,"It should have the option of transferring money from one hotel to another. After reaching 5 stars, there's nothing else to upgrade in the hotel. My Resort is in need of more money whereas my hotel has no longer need of money. It would be good if u let us buy the gems with the (in-game) money. Add more not-for-sale-gem items. The serious thing we need is the option to transfer money from hotel to hotel. Everything else is just good.",3,4,1.2.0
A Google user,"Gameplay is slow to begin with, it's really hard to build up, only made harder by the fact you need to remain in game to actually keep the hotel open. I like to grind my way through games but this is just abit too extreme. I like that you can pay to double your income permanently, pay to stop ads & pay to have the hotel make money whilst not being in game, but I think ¡ê10+ for this game of game is just too much, the graphics are too low to be charging people that. Enjoy playing tho 3/5.",3,4,1.2.2
A Google user,"Don't Bother This was fun until the 3rd hotel. Once there, videos won't load to double money, and when they do, the money doesn't double all the time.

A Google user,"This games is just designed for you to watch ads or buy their upgrades (which are absurdly expensive), if you decide to block the ads your hotels just won't have as much visitors as a normal ad game would have, every single thing you need in this game force you to watch an ad. It just sucks.",1,4,1.3.1
kathy lee,"Very slow progression when starting a hotel once you get to 2/3 stars the progress is rapid, to get to a star you do need to watch a lot of adverts that don't always work. It's a slow game so you can leave it for 24 hours quite easily and have enough money to do stuff.",3,4,1.9.8

Craig Chen,"Good game. After you finish one hotel, you do it all over again in a new hotel. Here's a problem. After I finish the Night Resort, I can't go to the next level to the Palace even though I max out everything in all hotels. So there's a bug in the game. Even though there's a bug, you will spend weeks on this game.",3,4,1.8.1
KimikoSAMA JD,"Fun game, was frustrating at first when you keep going into negative and you don't know why but got the hang of it eventually. Now been waiting for new content since last year I think.

John Barra,"There are some bugs, like when you buy upgrades for the rooms, when you press back it doesn't work. And the yellow starred facility and room means it's the most profitable right? But it says LOSSES! in yellow, which isn't helpful at all.",3,4,1.9.8
A Google user,Progression is extremely slow. Everything cost so much that ads are necessary if you want to buy upgrades or or pay salaries to the staff. Progress from the previous hotel does not affect the new hotel so there's no purpose in moving to the next hotel at all.,2,4,1.2.0
A Google user,Started off promising but soon became pointless. And if you want no ads than expect to drop around 17 Dollarydoos. That's a crazy amount for such a second rate lazy game. Another game I'm playing offered to remove adds for under a couple of dollars and I'm still playing that one. Poor effort from a group of people more interested in making money than creating decent content,1,4,1.3.0
Jazzy Ysj,"One of the better idle games that exist. You can literally hang out in game for hours, without the need to watch adds etc. However, it is worth the $17.99 aud for investor add on, that makes this game far better, more relaxing and more enjoyable. I would recommend whether you make an IN app purchase or not.",4,4,1.8.3
Vincensius Christopher,"It's fun but i had to pay 12$ just to get that no ads privilege, although i don't mind spending 12$ to support the devs it's kinda bad for the fact that players have to watch ads every single minute playing the game, it's not hotel tycoon it's like ad tycoon and for the love of God please fix the AI walking animation and route it's soooo bad. Just don't be the greedy EA of mobile games, literally.",3,4,1.8.2
A Google user,"Enjoyable game. More hotels needed. I am having issues with my guests getting annoyed and leaving the hotel when I have the maximum number of staff on each service (I can't see any way of increasing wages so that they work more quickly). Some of them are even getting annoyed because they want to use something past closing time. This is beyond my control, why is it happening?!",3,4,0.3.1
A Google user,This game outshines the others. There is a tad more to do as far as you are able to loose money as well as earn it and it makes it more difficult to make money at first. There is more upgrade options which is neat. I love the direction the developers are going on the game making.,5,4,1.1.1
Charmayne Brooks,This game unlike some of the similar games has taken the time to offer the user detailed areas to update Achieving the objective is gained through graphic changes that are tied to a chain of budget changes Working towards the objective is similar to filling in an intricate adult coloring book The page starts of as a black and white drawing and ends up however the user dresses it Most of the sound effects and all of the music is nice too,4,4,1.8.4
A Google user,"I like the game. However, one of your ads I believe Radish is very inappropriate for any child that plays this game. You rate it for 10+ but that particular ad is displaying more romantic geared ads that I dont think a 10 year old or older should see.

Siobhan Titzell,"I would give this game more as I really do enjoy it but its so glitch its beginning to make me go off of the game, for example since being in the second hotel I can't seem to watch ads to be able to skip the night or earn double profits and I've noticed when this happens the VIP is non-existent and I no longer get the taxi notification either which just ruins me playing the game",3,4,1.9.91
A Google user,This Manager Event is nice but way too short for the target goals you have set to reach without *having* to buy a pack.

denika perez,It was a fairly great game but After i opened the second hotel the gane went downhill. It stared refusing to open. I had to force stop and open just to get it to load.

Boxed like a fish,"Hi this is an incredibly funny and cool game.There are two problems I have tho.These both being hacks/glitches discovered by yours truly.Number one is if you close the app and reopen it,if you quickly go to watch ad to get two times money then spam where watch ad would be you get the double money for free no ad.Number two is that if you ask to watch an ad for 2x money and close the ad you still get the bonus.",5,4,1.8.4

Shannon,"So far, it's a pretty neat game. I like that the 2nd hotel level sounds like it offers even more challenges. The optional__(I appreciate__) coins-for-ad deals are pretty fair, too, and help speed 'the action' along.",5,4,1.9.7
A Google user,"Game is good as easy to upgrade and fun but the worst part is all hotels are not interconnected and you can not transfer earned money or profit or resources from established hotel. Once you upgrade hotel, its of no use as it will be making profit but can't use it anywhere else. Game can be made more interesting by making it more real life simulator.",1,4,1.2.2
John Cy,This game is nothing but a grind fest in which grinding only gets longer with each new hotel. And then what? Nothing. It feels very pointless after you begin to realize it halfway through. I'm not going to even bother to complete the last couple of hotels. Uninstalled.,1,4,1.9.93
Stephanie Osburn,Update #2 April 2022- I re-downloaded the game hoping it was better with the ads no longer glitching and it is!

The only thing you should do to run this thing smoothly is watching ads and gaining money for development but its very slowly so this game is to made you watch their endless ads. Dont waste time on this, there are more hotel tycoon better than this over there.",1,4,1.8.4

PRANESH BHOWAL,Yeah the game is very good i think if the things of the game could be 3D type then it would be more better for me more over i would like to look around the city in which my hotel exist like map and there should be a chareacter that denotes me and there should be some free land area from where we can build our hotel with the game money and do all expences what need to make it a hotel like eletrical wiring etc which will be visualise etc so this is only my review thats all thak you.,5,4,1.8.4
Kallie M,"I uninstalled a while ago but thought I'd give it another shot. I started playing and soon realized that if you want to succeed you need to spend real money, and I'm not one to spend a lot of money on a game. So unless the developers make it so u can buy with gems and it takes not too many gems, I'm uninstalling and I won't come back!!!",1,4,
jasmine henderson,Love this game. Just very very slow at getting new hotels updates. As I have completed all hotels and I have been awaiting ages and still no update with anew hotel. Also the even hotel is rubbish as you can never complete it with out spending real money on it. And it's the same boring hotel every time.,4,4,1.7.3
John Kohn,"For those of you who have already finished a couple codigames idle games and now you're trying this one, just a heads up: suuuuper slow start on this one. You'll spend the first 8-12 hours of gameplay just trying to stay out of the negative. Good game though. No better or worse than the other ones. Prison game type objectives with Law Firm game type atmosphere ___¡á_",5,4,1.9.97
Julie Sunshine,I like the game. The only think i dont like is that when my customers go to the restaurant and by exemple the maximum customers is 12 so i have some waiting.. but all the rest of them turn around and leave. They dont get mad or anything but its still money that i could have by them going to eat at the restaurant. Can you fix the bug so they would be waiting instead and maybe extend the time frame before they get pissed off. For now its my only critic.,4,4,1.8.4

Also I hate when the guests are going to eat and the chefs just walk out and they don't get to eat.

Not that there's too many of them because I will gladly watch an ad to get the investor money etc. but some of them are glitchy and causes you to miss out on extra funds for the game because it says that you didn't watch the whole ad when you did.",3,3,1.7.2

Mr G0GGLEZ,"Good game. Really enjoyable. The only reason I've not given 5* is because when you've fully upgraded your hotel and move onto the next one. You have to start again from scratch. You can't use any money you're making from previous hotels to help. So all the money youre making is just sitting there getting bigger because you can't invest it in the new one.

Lena G,"Really nice game, but sometimes you watch ads to get some coins, but after the ad is finished you didn't get your reward. Sometimes also struggles to start the ad if I want to play it.

A Google user,"It is a good game though trust me I'm not saying it's bad but it needs improvement. However, the game encourages ad watching to get money as getting money through playing the game is unbearably slow so they push the motive of watching ads to progress and the upgrades barely help with making more money to progress, other than the watching of Ads to progress, the redundancy of upgrading items to progress, and how slow it is to make money, I still think it's a good game if they fix the problems",2,3,1.2.0

A Google user,Overall this game is very good and I prefer it to their other title Gym Tyccon. I would have given it 5 stars but I think charging people ¡ê10 to keep their hotels active for 10 hours when the player is inactive is a little excessive.

Wishing I hadn't spent money on the game now but oh well we live and learn.,3,3,1.2.0
Snakeman 2k19,Needs at least double the amount of hotels. The weekly event ones are the same .....money grab...... waste of time ....pointless. once you get past the first star it's easy money n just takes a extra 2 days to finish that specific hotel. The dev team for this games needs to add more challenging ones. Not enough listed either. Can finish them all in under 3 weeks.,3,3,1.7.1

One thing though, Whenever I click on the VIP to watch an ad to get more money, it starts loading the ad, but then the ad stops loading and it goes back to the game without playing the ad. I don't get the money from the VIP and he just walks away. Other than that little bug, it's a very fun game. Please install.",4,3,1.2.0

Anyways best hotel game yet thank you.",4,3,
Thomas,It's not very engaging to play. Spend money to upgrade. Exit game for hours. Go back on and upgrade more. Hit yet another wall. Wait hours. Upgrade etc.... ads don't get you very far either. Overall a waste of time.,1,3,2.7
A Google user,Needs more levels as in hotels. The restaurants dont seat enough people and the game doesnt record money if the app is left open on the phone so hours could go by and those profits are not recorded. Great game otherwise. It's pretty has a simple user interface which is lovely and the goals to complete are enjoyable. The goals are limited unlike other games,4,3,1.5.0
A Google user,"Great game until you complete the second level. No way to progress past the second hotel without a forces in game purchase. I'm not sure I understand this concept with the current in game ads. Having the ability to watch adds for in game currency is a plus, I think this works well. Confused as to why your forced to perform in game purchases when your already provided the option to watch adds. This is obviously profitable for the game creator, why not just continue this concept for progressing?",2,3,1.7.1
Constantin Miguel Chen,"Ran into 2 issues; if you quit the game, the game removes guests from your hotel, and ad campaigns will never keep your hotel at max occupancy while offline. Tested multiple times, from a full hotel, quitting and immediately logging back in, suddenly 5 rooms were empty, and not even the highest ad campaign kept my hotel full, not even the starter one. Wouldn't had a higher rating otherwise. Also issues with UI bugs and some upgrades not granting additional income.",2,3,1.7.2
A Google user,"This game is very fun. You don't have to play the whole time and there are no so many ads. The only thing that bothers me is when I finish one lvl or I get one hotel to 5 stars, when I start another hotel I have no use of the old one. I hope there will be an update which solves this. Again this is no critic it's just my subjective opinion, the game deserves 5 stars.",5,3,
A Google user,"Love the game! Great to pass the time with, and enjoyable when I reopen and find some extra profit in my bank. I highly recommend paying to do without ads. It's painstaking to watch the ads, just to better advance in each hotel, so I found money well spent doing without them. Wish there was more to do after maxing out a hotel however, than to just watch the bank incease.",4,3,1.7.1
A Google user,"Everything's good for me except for two things. First, is It pushes you to do tasks. I'm saving money but it keeps telling me tou buy this and that __. Maybe program it as a suggestion or a reminder but not a mandatory thing. Second, the game can be played offline. I think it is absurd that you need to be online to get the rewards. __",4,3,1.4.2
Conk3r,"Hey I was enjoying it but when the ADS start freezing on the business guy that gives you chunks of money. That's extremely annoying. I can get past the 30 second ads, but freezing and having to reset the game and losing out on that chunk of money, is a 1 star for me.",1,3,1.8.1
A Google user,"First of all I'd like to say this game is pretty enjoyable and not at all time consuming. Its a game you open for a couple of minutes a day just to upgrade. However it's a little bit secretly pushy when it comes to irl purchases, giving you unrealistic event goals to purchase progress and often informing you that you're one click away from 2x ingame currency. Otherwise a good game for when you've got 5-10 minutes to spare",3,3,1.7.1
Rachel Ford,"Love this game. Nice and calm. Wish there was an option to prestige previous completed hotels. There's no point in returning to once complete. Great game but once you've completed it, it's pointless. Would love to be able to prestige to get higher returns on the hotels",3,3,1.8.4
Cracker Jack,Quick but fun game... did sink $20 bucks into this game. It was fun but short lived imho. I played this for almost a month before finishing all the levels. Would love to see more levels. Tweaks of the cafe is needed across all levels. It is fun watch all the people move around the hotels. My favorite hotel is the Xmas one.,4,3,1.7.3
A Google user,So I was throughly enjoying the game up to 3rd hotel and then when I clicked to watch an advert for some extra cash after the advert I did not receive my cash. After this happening a further 8 times I uninstalled and re installed. I have no lost my entire progress annoying me even more but the problem with the adverts have still continued. Throughly disappointed as I really wanted to reach the end,1,3,1.2.0
Amani Rose,Honestly think people are too hard on this game. Its actually really fun and the fun is dependent on not transferring money into other hotels. You have to work from he bottom for each hotels with a little I incentive at first to kick start it. Can earn more money from watching ads and I like this feature because it's completely up to you if you want to view the ads or not. Fun game over all. I've gotten 5 stars in 4 hotels so far.,5,3,1.7.2
A Google user,"Fun incremental game. Detailed, smooth gameplay. Ads are used appropriately. 5 stars would be customizable color palates for each room + the ability to make your staff. Very good game overall __ I'm amending this because none of my video rewards are processing. The ads keep freezing and restarting my game which cause me to lose huge profits. Extremely saddenig.",2,3,1.4.2
Luv1,Had to knock it down a star. The ads are no longer working (I've uninstalled/installed) and they are essential to clearing events. The screen just goes gray and you don't get to double your profits while away or in game play or get help from the money man.,4,3,1.9.91
A Google user,This is one of my favorite games ever. I think it is very fairly made tycoon and it is an amazing game. I wish I could give this game five stars but there is however one problem with this game. In the hotel restraunt guests sit down and eat but they only use one or two tables out of the six I have brought and upgraded. I constantly have customers with the angry face and did not have a meal. This is a bug I would like to be fixed. I love this game and hope an update will come soon.,5,3,1.2.1
A Google user,I actually really loved this game. Even spent money on it despite glitches like it offering tokens and not actually giving them. But then my phone died and all the money spent on tokens and all the effort into building 2 hotels was lost. It's making me start over and won't give my old game back even with it linked to my account. Huge frustrations. Please help,1,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"I really like the game at this moment, but there are some issues that have been annoying me really much, and the worst one being that when I click the double profit thing after being away from the game it doesn't actually give me the double amount. And it really annoyed me since I paid to not see ads",3,3,1.2.0
A Google user,Hi the reason i gave this 4 stars is because i this game is the one i have been looking for it ticks all the boxes with the reallity aspevt however there are a few things that i feel could enhance this game even more and the first one being that the hotel should be that when the hotel is full then the reception should be closed. The second thing is that there should be more things that can be upgradeable in the hotels and also another great feature could be adding in more rooms.,4,3,0.3.1
A Google user,"Good game but then got glitchy, would give it 4 or 5 stars if the ads didn't constantly glitch out and not provide what you need to advance. I don't know if paying for ad free would solve it but I'm not going to gamble to find out. I wouldn't recommend unless they get the bugs worked out.",1,3,1.2.0
_Bear Gaming_,"Hi, I really like this game alot and it's fun but what I don't like it is you need to play online and not offline. An other thing also there's a glitch that if I want the man money thing that if you watch an ad it makes money but I try want to click it, it all goes away. But that's all but without that glitch I would give 5 stars. Thank you -Annie",4,3,1.9.97
WIRACHAYA Tachakomol,"Highly recommend for tycoon gamers! Amazing fun! I love the user interface here __ easy to understand, cute symbols and I love the fact that the game didn't intentionally force player to watch commercials like other games. You can play in free mode but still nothing bother. It's smooth and player friendly and I spend more time playing! Actually all entire weekend lol. BTW I did purchase non-ads and it worth every penny.",5,3,1.7.2
A Google user,"I've completed the game in less than 1 month. A lot of things are in typo,such as wages for the staffs. in the third hotel you can have max 44 guests but max 6 guests in the queue for the restaurant it's ridiculous. Also the last hotel is a dissapointment. Nothing new, just a disco but the furnitures are all recycle from the previous hotels. The layout of the hotel is also boring, similar to the first hotel.",2,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"This game is fun. I like it very much but there are some issues that are making me not happy. Sometimes I watched the ads but I don't receive profit x2, money from investor or customer. Sometimes I can't even watch the ads. I just started a new hotel and really need profit x2 but didn't get it__",4,3,1.4.0
Ann Hadlow,"Well this game was fun until I opened another hotel and kept losing game money because it kept resetting it but keeping everything I upgraded. I would lose the patrons in my expensive rooms, lose the money and incur losses because I used the money I thought I earned to upgrade before it reset on me. Half the time the videos didn't even work.",1,3,1.7.2
Brandon Hamer,"Very good. Very few unavoidable ads. I'd suggest that staff training should be a thing; Cleaners should have better route finding with training; chefs should have higher customer capacity with training (so the seats can be filled). Add a waiters upgrade to reduce the eating time slightly. These can all be offset by profit margins. At the moment, the restaurants can be fully upgraded without nearly reaching either seating or customer capacity.",4,3,1.7.3
Philip Kelle,"It's a good game, not a pay to win, you do have to grind though. I think they should add a prestige system when you finish a hotel though. Like after you get so much money at a fully upgrade hotel you get another floor. Great game though!",4,3,1.9.8
A Google user,The game is a scam you can play the game up to hotel two then you can't buy anymore because you need 9 gold stars. So you can get 4 gold stars on each hotel but you need 9 to unlock the next hotel you can't complete any more tasks to get more gems so the only option you have is to buy gems to unlock next hotel. Also all this game is made for is to make money everything an ad or pay to not have ads or pay to have your hotel stay open. Very disappointed would have been a good game .,1,3,1.2.1
A Google user,"I actually really like the game, however I started noticing around hotel #3 that it didnt take in more than a certain amount of clients even if you had a lot of rooms available. Additionally the last hotel was a disappointment. They mixed designs from the beach hotel and the first one, I just felt like it was thrown together last minute.",3,3,1.2.1
A Google user,"Its fun, engaging, and informative. It gives a more accurate experience in running, managing, and financing your hotels and stall. With informative statistics, wages, and bills to be conducted and ran like a boss should. I really love it! ____",5,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"It's not a bad game just relies too much on the ads to upgrade and for only making money for each in game hour instead of paying for the room itself you waste money on the staff pay compared to the rooms itself. Besides being very slow to start and the power consumption being too out of proportion, it's not too bad of a game.",3,3,1.5.0
A Google user,"Can't stop playing it. You will love it. Go in upgrade get out. Makes you want to complete each hotel. You start out with a raggedy hotel. Then as you go each hotel has more amenities. Spas, pools, restaurant, bars and more. Great game.",5,3,1.5.0
A Google user,"Let me preface with the game itself is straight forward and could do a good job as a sporatic distraction However this game has flaws You only get 2 hours backlogged unless you pay ingame to expand it to 10 hours This game does have some annoying and frequent bugs: Ads will go black screen and force app restart People getting stuck in place when going to a closed services & requires restart Crashing during ads Pathing is unoptimized and in need of overhaul If you restart, you lose guests",2,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"The game is ok, but not sure if there's any point going back to a hotel after building all non premium items and completing all goals. Also can't forgive the lazy programming, sprites clip through each other and cars (my chefs are ""run over"" on arrival and everyone walls through parked cars).",2,3,1.2.1
Emily Smith,Was fun to play from time to time. Now it keeps glitching. Watch the ads for double money bonus then it vanishes and the same with the amount of money. Now it's saying it can't connect to the internet when using regular data or wifi.,2,3,1.8.1
Mitchell Mellin,Game is fun but weekly event goals unachievable. Only way I see to achieve the top goals is to pay to win! I have maxed out all the hotels and have absolutely nothing to do with the game Dropping to 2 stars as they need to add more hotels or make the weekly challenge not the same thing every week,2,3,1.8.4
A Google user,Cannot receive investment funds. The videos dont play out and you dont get the money. It annoying because it a really good game. But you cant upgrade fast unless you just dont play and go back to see how much you made to upgrade.__,3,3,1.2.0
Kyle United,If it was possible to leave a zero star rating I would. Since its updated the game stops providing ads after 2/3 hours leaving you to either uninstall and reinstall the game or watch a loading screen for hours. When you finally do reinstall it erases all of your progress over the last 2 hours. #Pissed,1,3,1.9.91
Oswald Colinolie,I simply love it!!!! It is not just like any tyccon it adds things that other games usually don't like having to pay wages and having to upgrade the rooms and services to make more money. It requires your attention every once in a while and i love that. 10/10,5,3,1.8.4
Lady Deathbat1995,"I love this game, I really do. The only issue I have is the ads almost never work and it becomes beyond frustrating because it's extremely difficult to progress without them especially on the events. Please do something to fix this.",3,3,2.3.1
Aaron Harding,"Seems like it could be fun, but there is just too much asking for real money on every little thing. If you bought everything it would cost more than a playstation game and even then you'd still need to watch ads to progress. Just too greedy in my opinion.",1,3,1.7.2
A Google user,"Boring game, i usually like 80% of the idle games i play but this one is just entirely too grindy. Also, i dont know if im just missing something or the games messed up. I upgrade a sink in a room for it to earn $6 instead of the $3 i am currently earning. Then o go to the big stats where it shows all the income, and it only shows im earning $2.76 from that sink that should be earning $6.",1,3,1.1.1
A Google user,"I like the game,only problem is money from my other hotels should be able to be used on all the hotels.all my upgrades are maxed out on 1 hotel I should be able to carry the revenue to another.So I have a lot of money I can't use.I've spent real cash on this game but 10.99 for manager,10.99 for the dog and 4.99 are too much. Too high the game is NOT worth 26.00 I cant move to the third hotel because I can no longer get stars.I need 2 more. All tasks have been completed, I guess I'm uninstalling",1,3,1.2.0
Paige Farrelly,"Great game, love playing it and keeping up the only issue I would have which isn't a problem it's just how long it takes to get the business up and going the income isnt the best to start with butim sure it will get better as you go.

M Bahad_r TOMA_,"Urgh what is this??? You cant have a progress unless you watch ads and still some ads dont work. Also, everything is too expensive. Yeah the grafics, details, gameplay are realy good but it is impossible to play unless you pay a lot or watch ads in every a few min",1,3,1.7.1
Wren Penrith,decent until you get to the second last hotel where it pretty much becomes impossible to advance any further without saving ridiculous amounts of money. you upgrade things in the rooms and expect to get more money next time you go on the game but never do? probably going to uninstall as i'm just not progressing anymore,3,3,1.8.4
A Google user,Impossible to play. Constantly at 0 money. Losing faster than can be earned. This is by default! No extra expenses other than ones game starts with. First housekeeper and receptionist should have no upkeep. It feels rigged to get you to pay for normal gameplay.,1,3,1.0
A Google user,"Was loving the game until I got to my 3rd hotel..game started glitching really bad, videos will not load, when you get out and go back later over half the rooms that were full are empty and the video for double profits does not give you what is promised. What is the purpose of being able to visit finished hotels when all you can do is collect money? You cant even take a portion of it to help with the others and all upgrades are done..getting boring and frustrating",1,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"Great game just a few hiccups. Like how it takes to long for the people to walk places so things close before they get there. Also I can have no vacancies, log out of the game and right back in within seconds and have 6 vacancies. Also it would be nice in the bigger hotels if the chefs could feed eveyone, right now its only like half before they either close or the guest deside it is too long to wait. Im full upgraded too. I love the extra cash you get for watching ads, and the double cash.",3,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"Way too many Ads..Also, I make so much money on my first hotel and even the prices of items at the second one are doubled, I can't use my profits and have to watch another ton of Ads to reach any goal, which still won't let me have 5 stars. Uninstalling.",1,3,1.3.0
Sorin,"It's a great game, but I would love to see some sort of money transfer between hotels. Like when you finish the first hotel it would be nice to transfer money from that one to any other of your hotels so you have the option of not being broke in the game the whole time. ^^",4,3,1.7.3
Michael Lundin,"Last night the game was working fine, this morning it won't load. Loading bar goes full with the scrolling advice but it never enters the game.

A Google user,Issue is when i play ads sometimes it triggers the ad to play and sometimes it is about to trigger the ad before it stop it from fully activating. So ill click for the ad to trigger to get money from the rich guy and sometimes the ad play sometimes it doesnt so I'm missing out on money that I should get for trying to play the ad. When I close the game and restart it fixes the problem. Then it starts u again randomly not playing ads.,3,3,1.1.1
Tristan Dean,"I love the game however during my second event, the one with Boney Mars, I bought all upgrades and even spent the ¡ê10 on the presidential suites with roughly 3 days left to go. After 2 days i had collected around ¡ê160m. I left the game to gather money knowing I could double it when I returned. I returned to the game and my money hadn't gone up and I had only collected around ¡ê16k so I couldn't get the 3 stars for the event. Please fix or reimburse me. Will give 5 stars after it's fixed. Thanks",2,3,1.7.1
A Google user,It's an alright game.very challenging but I love it. It would be cool if we could upgrade or add stuff to the completed hotel instead of earning lots of money and not being able to use it in the new hotels,4,3,1.2.0
A Google user,This game is really fun and I Really enjoy playing it. I like that there are no pop-ups. The one thing that I find is annoying is that you have to add additional batteries for the power your hotel uses. Another thing is that you can't add more than two small rooms. Overall this game is super fun and intertaining. I would suggest it to anyone who is bored and needs something to do.,4,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"I love this Game! But... The problem is I have finished my first hotel, now what am I meant to do!? I have started on the second Hotel and it is slow going , everything is more expensive to upgrade ,so have to wait a few days to purchase items, whilst my first Hotel is still making Money and I can not purchase anything in the first Hotel anymore!

Bryce Gerard J. De Tomas (Random Person),"It's a fun game but when you unlock the Stanley Resort it becomes boring. I mean, after you finish the Codihotel, what will you do with the money? You won't be able to spend that money on other hotels, you can't transfer money between the hotels you own. If there's an update where you can now transfer money, I'll turn this review into a 5-star review.",3,3,1.8.4
A Google user,It is better than others because it is a little harder but not to hard that you quit. And all the little things you can do in the rooms to upgrade is good for when you are bored. It's like a mind game like for if you want to save and by something that gives you big profit or to by something now for I very little profit. And the power generator is a good touch.,4,3,1.2.0

Overall though I am happy with it and hope there is much more to be unlocked as I play more.",4,3,1.3.0
A Google user,"It's a simple game that lacks depth. You have no control over the layout of rooms and simply upgrade different aspects of rooms with no choice or variety between furniture. Your employees just walk out the second you have no money to pay them. It would be nice if we could get a loan or something and go into debt, similar to real life.

me !,"Good game. A little too many ads, but its fine. My main problem is with the restaurant room.

The game is nice, just this feature is off :(",4,3,1.2.1
A Google user,Better than the other Codigames I've played. This one has just that much more intricacy and character. I like that you don't wipe out your earlier hotels and get to keep working on them as you progress at other locations. Makes it feel realer. My biggest complaint is that the 2x multiplier only gets you a 10 minute boost at a time. I watch enough ads with the VIP guy and the instant sunrise; can't you give me an hour or so for the multiplier?,4,3,1.4.0
A Google user,"Played 5h, fun, cute polished game, but. You are not really managing a hotel just building it. The only thing you can do in the game is built rooms, a restaurant and a bar from a list. Nothing else, you don't manage anything apart from watching commercials. And boy i haven't watched so many videos in my life. It's like one video every 3 minutes. There is also something wrong with the the star system: built all rooms a full upg bar and a full upg restaurant, bam 2 stars",3,3,1.2.0

A Google user,Why can't I transfer the amount I made with the first hotel into the rest? With the new hotel the costs are super high for everything.

A Google user,"The game is definitely enjoyable, as I work in hotels. I'm more than a little disappointed with hotel guest AI, as the guests ALWAYS do the same thing everyday; wake up, go to restaurant, go to bar, go to other random outlets until they've visited them all, then check out. This would be more acceptable if the hours of operation of f&b and other outlets could be managed. Often guests try to walk in to closed outlets. And also they game's major check-in time is before guests check out.",3,3,1.6.0

Never give 5 stars, but if this genre of game is your cup of tea it's a 5 for you",4,3,1.1.1
Shannon Davison,Game is such a joke. Asks if you want to watch ads for rewards and then doesn't give you the rewards! I've contacted the developers with photo evidence and just been ignored. Also closed this app when it was supposedly midnight. Reopened at 4am and 3 of my hotel rooms had suddenly been emptied. Makes it so hard to earn money as the game empties the most expensive rooms,1,3,1.7.2
Sweet Cocoa,"Update: it lies about the payout for watching ads, it will have 1 price amount for watching it and after your're done it doesn't pay you what is owed. Also everythibg start off exoensive and you can't upgrade because it takes so long to earn money.",2,3,1.9.8
Meghan Eley,"Good game, kills time and doesn't need constant watching! Only gave 4 stars as the adverts haven't been available for most of my playing time, which makes it take longer to upgrade everything!",4,3,1.9.8
A Google user,"Excellent management game best one of your games yet but it's still pretty dry tho needs more substance, so here I think I can share my opinion to probably add more entertainment like bowling , basketball , night clubs , spa and etc...Also I'd like to suggest adding VIP's or celebrities that offer you more money but they appear bot so occasionally. Overall great game!",5,3,1.1.1
A Google user,I love this game I've had it for a month and I've already got all the hotels .This game is AMAZING .I would reccomend this game for any ages it's a fun enjoyable experience (you could even play it all together) hotel empire tycoon is never glitchy and it doesn't freeze .This game is definitely 5 stars .,5,3,1.7.1
Talha Gujjar,This is a very good game I like this game so much but now I am facing some glitches in this game can you guys fix them 1. When I was playing game there were customer in single room and double room I go to codi hotel for some time when I came back there was only customer in single room and when I get offline it happened too 2. The guy who gives money for watching ads he came and go we don't get a option to see ad then he came back and we can see ad after seeing ad 2sec later he came back,4,3,1.9.97
Kassy Mankiewicz,"I love this game and all, but when I paid for VIP for event hotel like a week ago, that VIP didn't carry onto this new event hotel, so I'm not sure about that, because I paid $10.99 for it, and it doesn't stay permanent? I'm super confused about this. I wish it stayed, and I wish the event hotel would stay with the same progress every time there is one.",4,3,1.7.1
A Google user,Be careful out will suck your data dry. I have the game installed for three days and it has used over 1gb of data. Don't know if it's the ads or what but don't play this game with your mobile data on. Other than that the game becomes boring because there's not much to it but upgrade the rooms.,1,3,1.6.0
A Google user,"Great for killing time, you don't need to spend hours of your day to be successful at it, and you don't need to spend money to make it through! (But you can, so you don't have to watch ads, and the little dog eating the ads appears in the manager's office, which is an adorable little touch I really appreciated.) But now that I've finished all the hotels with 20 stars __ what do I do next?",5,3,1.2.0
A Google user,I was really enjoying this game. Until I got to the 2nd hotel I have bought everything I can in both of the hotels however I cannot move onto the next one as u have to have 9 stars and I have 0 gems left as I wasn't aware I should have saved them to spend on the 1st hotel to get it to 5 stars before I could move on. So now due to a lack of storage on my phone I will have to delete the game.,5,3,1.2.0
GOPALAKRISHNA DAMALE,Great Game for time pass but the salary of the workers is too high. That is my opinion as I am a begeniner. Overall great game. I just didn't have it 5 stars because of that reason. This reason doesn't stop me to tell my friends to download the game. I don't want you to decrease the salary of workers because that makes the game hard,4,3,1.9.97
Flawed Diamond,"I don't appreciate you removing my comments! This is just a game of ads! Even if you sent me a comment back! Just an option isn't part of the game, you can't get ahead without watching! Just another idle game with tons of ads or extremely high out of pocket money to buy.",1,3,1.8.4
A Google user,I liked this game until it glitched and took earnings without delivering the suite. What a bummer. I'll give it a day to update and correct itself but going to be a no on this one for me. Update- game deleted prior to snarky comment from developer. Of course I looked for the suites all over the map before I gave a review. Accept that your app is glitchy.,1,3,1.3.1
A Google user,Is a good game but way too many ads. For everything bonus in the game you have to watch an advert and some of them are nearly 1 min long. It gets very tedious after a while,1,3,1.7.1
A Google user,"This game is great for 5 stars it's easy to just sit back for a few hours to generate in game revenue then up upgrade, plus this is way easier than all the other games the developer makes plz continue to add more content I really enjoy your game.

A Google user,"this is totally suck!!! when i almost completed the game suddenly u guys pull monkey tricks on me! i cant even access to the game so many times. i have uninstall and install it over & over again.. after all the effort, money and time put for this game this is totally disappointing and frustrating! gonna uninstall for good!!!!! such a lousy game!!!",1,3,1.3.0
A Google user,"I've been waiting for updates as I've upgraded all my hotels. The last hotel, the Santa one I've been maxed out on for the last week but it only has 4 stars. I figured that it was cause there was no other hotel to move on too. But I seen that there was an update today so I updated thinking that I'd get my 5th star & be able to move on to the next hotel, but it wasn't the case! So frustrating as I love the game, I want to keep playing but I can't. Fix it & I'll give it the 5 stars!",2,3,1.3.0
Rajan Kumar,The game release event on ever week and they to make money have designed the game in such a way that you sure have to watch ads to make money however the reason I have rated it worst because even though I want to watch adds there are no add I can watch not sure if it's a glitch or anything else I have tried all the tech stuff and troubleshooting but I like the concept of the game part but not how it's designed to reach goals as it give 3 days time to make 1.3 million,1,3,1.9.7
A Google user,Great app. Love the way they make you think about how much you spend vs employees will effect your closure of your hotel. Will get help from the dancing rich guy who comes in the lobby if you are willing to sit through ads One thing I do wish is I could carry on building the hotel after the level has passed since you can go back to the previous hotel but can't keep building the hotel. I dont usually download tycoon apps since they end up being really bad but this one surprised me.,4,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"Love the game, shame there isnt much content at the moment. One issue with the game, on a Galaxy S10+, the diamond counter in the top right corner is blocked by the camera and cannot be seen, is this something that you're away of? Other than that, great game!",5,3,0.2.1
A Google user,I loved the game at first but after you get to the last hotel you have to wait FOREVER for them to add new hotels. I've been done with the game for at least three weeks and updated my game once and there still isn't anything else I can do. It's almost a waste of time. I'll give more stars if they keep up with their game,3,3,1.2.2
A Google user,"I like it! I hate most ""build and wait or buy"" games, but this one is actually pretty good... you really don't have to wait... I think the VIP might be the reason? Anyways, you don't have to wait for upgrades to finish or anything like that, you're just waiting for more money.",5,3,1.2.1
Michael Slattery,Game got ruined when they added event hotels. They havent added any new hotels in a while. They only do event hotels and You can never beat them without spending actual money. The app probably makes more money off the event hotel's. No point in playing unless you want to spend money on a game.,1,3,1.8.4
A Google user,"It was great when it worked. It was so addicting snd fun to play at first. Now the app wont open anymore. I just comes up with a screen saying, ""Warning"" ""Download"". It wont let me download anything. So no game for me I guess.",3,3,0.3.0
A Google user,"whew i like this game..1 thing i dont like every time new place open,i need a big amount of cash to keep the hotel running smoothly..and how to keep my hotel run smoothly is by pushing player to watch ads..that was brilliant idea..you should got apllause for that..and that make you lose 1 star..and another 2 star lose because all my progress before is gone before update i play and open new place..and now i have to start from zero back..uninstall again",2,3,1.3.1
A Google user,"I wanted to rate this game with 5 stars, although I suggest to add more places where we can build more hotels, with more stuff and activities in them that we can add, but this game is really something I see great things for this game in the future so keep up the good work, love it _ __",5,3,1.2.0
A Google user,"I really enjoy this game but there are a few issues, number 1 i think if you've completed the 1st hotel and it's still making money you should be able to use that money for your other hotels and 2 i still have tasks to do in the 1st hotel even though ive fully completed it? And there are no tasks in the second hotel?",5,3,0.3.1
A Google user,Love this game! A good amount of ad watching but I dont mind as the amounts of money you get from watching ads increases. The only thing I would add is to be able to interact with guests. I keep seeing that they are upset or angry and I just wish I could find out why. Great game to play while watching tv.,5,3,1.1.1
Mritunjay Singh,This game is very fantastic . I really enjoyed it. And i want more new features in this game .This game is like a real hotel management .when i saw the name of this game at that time i thought it was nice and really it was really nice .Every day i play this game .

A Google user,"It's so frustrating that even though I watch ads for x2 profit I still get the profit I had before... For example, after opening the game I had 10000 cash and 10000 profit since I left the game. The thing with x2 profit if I watch an ad pops up and I watch it. I should get 20000 now that I had watched the ad, but no. I get only the 10000. So instead of having 30000 cash, I have 20000 and a lot of frustration. I have proof+the game is more pay-to-win or you need to watch a ton of ads to play :)",1,3,1.2.0

I have one room that has not been fully upgraded to get 5 stars, Its like 98%, but i have insufficient energy to do so.

THANK YOU FOR FIXING THE ENERGY GLITCH.",4,3,1.4.4
Amanda Lott,"I changed my rating to one star because when I was able to pay for the extra stuff for the event hotels I had no problems, but since I have been laid off and am unable to pay it keeps cheating me out of my prophets and therefore I am unable to even try to complete it...I don't even want to play anymore...deleting this game",1,3,1.7.2
A Google user,"Once you have a decent amount of money then you can actually do something in the game, but what's annoying is that the biggest source of money (by far) comes from you just sitting there and waiting for an ad every 60sec or so. Everything else doesn't even come close to be called income",3,3,1.2.0
A Google user,It would be great that when I have 44 guest that I would also have 44 places to sit in the restaurant instead on only 12 free ones. I lose a lot of money because you guys cannot make the restaurant in the size of how many guest are on that level. 12 guests can sit in the restaurant and the other 32 guests have to leave because of the to ring restaurant.

Alex Brown,6 giant permanent pop ups on screen begging me to spend $11 to $110 and no way to hide it. Almost a quarter of the screen is covered by advertisements. There is 0 chance I would ever spend a dime on this game when the devs do stuff like that.,1,3,1.8.4
Joshua Henderson,Not offline game! I dont have internet on my tablet yet so I downloaded off my hotspot then try to play without it then the game wouldnt load because it need the internet. So the game isnt an offline game that why you get only one star. Also everything in the game is way to much to upgrade or do anything because it take hours to upgrade any thing.,1,3,1.7.3

Otherwise you're bombarded with opportunities to watch ads and the game's a chore to play. Think of it as a demo and once you ""buy"" the game it gets way more enjoyable.",4,2,1.8.3
A Google user,"It's addicting!! I like it but wish I could do more than 2 levels without having to pay real money to advance. You need 9 stars for the third hotel and I can only get 8 before I have to buy ""gems"" to upgrade different rooms to be able to get another star. It's disappointing but guess they have to make money somehow...",2,2,1.2.0
Sammi Doe,I really enjoy newrly all of the idles they offer. Love how my hotels upgrade in looks with each of my upgrades. It really keeps me coming back to play this and their others. I'd give them 5 starts if the ads i watched for double profits lasted more than 10 minutes per ad. Its annoying to have to watch 12 in a row for a full bar to play the next couple hours actively.,4,2,1.8.3
Dan Paris,"The gameplay is nothing gr8. In order to progress they have 15-30 sec ads you can watch to gain $ faster. The trouble is most of the time you wont get the promised $ after the ad. It's quite difficult to complete an events without this helpful progression from ads. I've sent in support tickets about this and nothing is resolved. If u play, dont do events, you wont get them. After the 1st hotel, the game gets VERY repetitive, but at a higher cost. **uninstalling!!",2,2,1.7.2
A Google user,"I just purchased the bar and have enjoyed the game so far. There is a nice balance of idle and online management. You can open the game and do a few upgrades, start different advertising and get some offline bonuses in the span of 5 to 10 minutes. If you've got more time, you can play the game for upwards of an hour and still have things to do and tasks to complete.",4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Hotel Empire Tycoon is one of the best idle games I've played since it's just so satisfying to manage your staff and grow your hotels. But the ads aren't something to ignore, since calling the ad boosters appealing would be an understatement. The game has an amazing base but it's bogged down by a cripplingly slow progression, especially at the start, like most idle games nowadays.",3,2,1.1.1
Jace Craft,"The game is good, but i dislike how when a hotel is 5 stars there is nothing left to do with it. It would be nice when you are done with a hotel, you could do something like resetting while getting faster income (for that hotel of course) That would make the game a lot more interesting as you would manage more then 1 hotel for most of the time. Otherwise, the game is pretty good. Upgrading everything is pretty fun, you have to invest money pretty wisely and you also dont have to watch ads often.",4,2,
A Google user,It's fun and all but when I keep wanting to watch the ads for extra money it acts like there's no ad but I reload it and push the bonus again and it gives me a 45 second ad for very miniscul amount of money. And I feel the ad bonus where u can double the time is very accurate. Other than that it's a fun time killer keeps me coming back time again. Update: I've determined the double profit time isn't accurate which is disheartening,4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"This game is awesome! Graphics are good, strategy is needed, and it challenges you. It is hard to get started, just as any real hotel would be, but once you get going it's awesome!

A Google user,"This game is so much fun! Way too addicting, maybe :) Just finished the Santa hotel..... now when is the next update with another hotel or two?? My only critique would be, the more you upgrade the hotels, the game seems to start lagging a bit-- the little people sometimes get frozen in place and the only fix is leaving the hotel & coming back or restarting the app completely, kind of annoying. But really, awesome idle game ____",4,2,1.2.0
Jake Long,"Edit 2, its annoying having your managment building light up even youve completed the event and just havent bought the presidental suite because it cost 10 real dollars. Edit: so there was a new update finally, idk if there is actually new missions. every existing hotel for me was already 100% so it just made me claim all new or old it seemed. Still no new hotel unless you count the event hotel, which I don't, they've had events for years now. This game needs a new hotel that's not an event.",2,2,3
Charlene McInally,Really got into game. First time i had to reinstall and okay again as it stopped giving adverts. The second time i was constantly clearing my cache and when i pressedthe watch advert button it would do nothing. Pointless to havr a game based on money gained from ads and not have the ads work.,1,2,2.9
Kirsty,I really enjoy this game! The ads aren't forced - you choose to watch them in exchange for boosts/ money which makes it a little easier! I find this a good game to play every so often and like that you can go back to your old hotels too,5,2,2.9
Angel Marie (Angelmarie64),"Left the game for a few minutes and when I came back it removed $17,000,000 and only gave me the amount earned while I was offline. Also immediately removes my VIP campaign almost every time I exit the game.",5,2,3
Ruth Elisabeth L,"I love this game, i have complete all the hotel levels, 5 stars for every hotel but the saddest thing is when u complete upgrade all of the hotel till 5 star it seems like you're done playing this... so i don't have any reason for keeping the game in my phone___¡á_ #Pro tip: you'll get money by watching all of the ads from the dancing king this will help u upgrade ur hotels",5,2,2.9
A Google user,Good game but could be much better. I didn't like the extremely slow gameplay that requires you keep watching adverts to speed up profits. The fact that i have to complete a hotel before i can unlock the next ruins any hope of managing more than one hotel at a time so don't see the point of being able to travel back to the previous ones. More management options should be included as all you can do right now is unlock and upgrade and wait.,3,2,1.2.0
A Google user,I've really enjoyed this game. However I give it 4 stars as 1) I have completed it and there is literally nothing left for me to do on it and 2) it would be great if you could actually choose the decoration? Like the room colours etc as the final product of the rooms look messy and nothing matches and it would just add another string to this bow.,4,2,1.2.2
A Google user,"Its a fun game and a good time waster, I don't even mind the adds all that much, but there needs to be a fix in the AI at some point that either lets the guests tell what time it is or the limitations on number of guests using the facilities needs to change to reflect open seating. Guest pathfinding breaks down in higher levels and half of them never end up using the attractions so even though all of them are required they're not actually worth it to include :/",3,2,1.5.0
A Google user,"Like the game a lot, but umm... Where is the rest?! Finished the four hotels in well under a month... paid for the two ¡ê10 upgrades - no ads (every 10-15 seconds was driving me insane!) and hotel open of ten hours idle - and frankly feeling somewhat cheated! In terms of gameplay, pretty good graphics and good range of rooms to build. Needs to have interaction between hotels, as once at 5* never need to visit again.",3,2,1.2.0
Rebecca Barrett,"Its a fun game. But i've been stuck on the newest hotel and havent really played in a while as clicking one upgrade freeze the game for several seconds, and if you tap it go up multiple levels, it freezes and sometimes your taps dont register. Would be great if the lag or freezing could be patched in the next update, maybe then i'll be playing it again, especially since i've paid real money on this",3,2,
A Google user,"Not a bad game but prices to upgrade or build something are quite high, you have to collect enough money, if not your staff quit and so on.

Also i wish the money from other hotels could be used in the one i'm expanding.",3,2,1.3.0
Plummybobs Simsations,"Really fun, needs more content. Finished the game, no more hotels to upgrade. Fun to do the event time to time, but kind of pointless to get the rewards since i have no hotels to upgrade. Event hotel is always the same Lots of repeat furniture throughout the games hotels. Overall gameplay was fun, i love the art syle and i had a lot of fun completing, it just needs more content.",4,2,1.7.2
A Google user,"I enjoyed the game. I disliked the third resort (due to placements, spacing and general price for stuff...). Currently finishing the fourth/last hotel, which sucks since I enjoy the final hotel. If you don't have the x2 purchase, i feel this game would be way to much work to keep up. I had all 3 purchasables, and enjoyed the expenses addition (played many idle games similar, but this was a first for expenses). Overall, I had fun and hope they'll be future hotels added.",4,2,1.2.1
A Google user,"Very fun management game. There's just a little bit of exploration on the add feature, you have to watch way to many adds to have normal progress. It would be also nice if the game had Google play achievements, but that's just a personal preference of mine.",4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Seems like a pretty easy, great game. However, when I leave the game for a bit, then go back onto it. And the option where you click on profit x2, well I click on that, watch the add, it shows my profit has been doubled. But doesn't actually put it into my hotel game balance.",3,2,1.1.1
Rue W,"great graphics, love strategy component, enjoyable gameplay, highly recommend",5,2,3
A Google user,"I like the game, but it has quite a few a issues. Great example is that if you accidentally close or get a call ever for a second while you are launching a game you will lose your rewards collected while you were away. Also if you close (not even fully) the app your guests will change (often the most profitable room will suddenly become empty) and your daily earnings will drop. Some guests get stuck in your hotel for several days or new cannot come in even when there are empty rooms.",3,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Great game, got hooked quickly! Only issues are there are literally only 4 hotels (have been waiting a while for more...), one of which is essentially a duplicate of the trainee hotel you have first and that you don't gain even a percentage of the profits from the previous hotels which in a hotel empire would really happen. Fix these two and so long as there are plenty of hotels I'll continue playing __",4,2,1.2.1

Khatirana,Unfortunately the videos to obtain coins or new cust do not work anymore. You can use them once or twice and the you have to reboot the game..again and again. The event hotel is always the same so after doing it once there is no point in trying again. Unless the videos probs are not sorted I'll delete this game. Tried to send email but did not work. Bit poor and as it is today no worth the trouble to download.,2,2,1.7.2
A Google user,"Absolutely ridiculous event open for only 8 hours that is literally impossible to get rewards with unless you pay to have unlimited access to the event. Instead of wasting my time by pretending that you can finish the event without pay, advertise it as a paid for level. Already paid for other things, not being conned into paying for that. Just closed the app as a room was bugged and lost several thousand worth of progress. Going to try and refund.",1,2,1.4.0

A Google user,"Really enjoying this. There's no pressure to spend real money. Progress is realistic yet a bit of a challenge to make it fun. Videos/ads are an option to increase progress but not a constant pop up type, which is great. Don't change any of these factors :)",5,2,1.4.2
A Google user,Want to give a five star but 2 things bother me a lot. First is the bug where if i switch my hotel to the first one or just quit the game and reopen then the double bed rooms go empty even if there were people a sec ago before i switched. so that makes me go for loss for no reason. And second one is that after we upgrade a hotel to 5 star rating then there is nothing else to do. The money keeps piling up and that's it. We should be able to transfer funds to our newer hotel or give more upgrades.,2,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Reall good game, exciting and challenging because you literally have to balance the expenses and more.

My first hotel has 5 stars already and there's nothing else I can upgrade __ while the other hotel of mine is running out of funds ______",4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"The game, whilst enjoyable, has a considerable bug. When changing hotels or exiting the game to ""idle"" the hotel seems to lose a number of guests. This is rather frustrating if you think you've left in a good state to not. Also ¡ê10 for removal of adds is extortion- had it been ¡ê4.99 i might have considered it.",3,2,1.3.1
A Google user,I think there could be a little more to the game. It just doesn't offer much to really distinct itself from other games like it as much as it could. The game has gotten a better I like the addition of new hotels.

A Google user,"Always dreamed of running a hotel, this makes it fun and easy. Great for setting up and letting it run, and for budget management skills. Having to create your own electricity doesn't make sense and is expensive and delays progress, otherwise would have 5 stars.",4,2,1.7.1

A Google user,"Of all the tycoon in codigames, this one by far is the most challenging and i like it for that. This game is a little specific when it comes to upgrading something in the game, you eve need to uprade even items like tv, the bed etc., Instead of just uprading rooms. The downside is, when youre hooked with it and youve made it far already, ads arent enough, you need to start paying real money just to get ahead. Its dissapointing.",3,2,1.2.0

A Google user,So far it's pretty nice but still a little confusing on how to get some of the challenges done. Such as the wordings used to describe things in the game to be upgraded confused me. Either I'm hella uncultured or the names just don't feel right to call it that. Either way really nice game and people should give it a go and see how far they get.,4,2,1.5.0
A Google user,"The finance expert rarely works; It will not let me watch an ad to earn extra money, it automatically closes it and he walks off. It takes forever to accumulate money & upgrade. You have to watch an ad, but it only gives you 2x profit for only 10 minutes.",2,2,1.2.0

Angie Boney,Well Im addicted! First off there are so many ads but absolutely worth the payout. Graphics are good too!

A Google user,I enjoyed it. The main thing is how sllooowwwww it is to earn money! I would have to always click on the dancing guy to get enough money to upgrade. Earning diamonds is hard. I feel like this game was me watching ads most of the time! It's a pointless tycoon games. I'm going to uninstall for sure.,2,2,1.3.1
A Google user,"Quite slow in the beginning to collect money. You need to persevere by watching ads. Things will pick up after you have build enough facilities for guests, just need to take it slow and easy. Games like this are not for thrills and excitement, like most building games.",3,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"I look forward to any new hotels they add. It's a game that takes patience to earn enough money. It's not a pay to win game but paying the once to permanently remove ads is worth it, just don't uninstall the game. Cons are that you can't use money earned at previous hotel at new one & there aren't enough tasks that reward enough gems to get the all the special items. Special Events are impossible to do unless you pay sadly",4,2,1.5.0
Carl Moore,"Awesome game, few issues though. Yes, there has to be some sort of dynamic whereby you have less than 100% occupancy. However, this is impossible given the amount of visitors, and if you watch the hotel you always get 100% occupancy, but if you close the app then come back, it's 2am and 3 rooms are magically unoccupied. Also, some of the ads don't pay just through a glitch, the Seven Seas ad never pays, and most ads are for apps like Mistplay. Check their reviews on TrustPilot.",4,2,2.4

A Google user,"Giving this game 3 stars might be a little harsh. It's a good time killer and the concept is fairly simple. However, it seems to take forever to grind money to make your hotels better and then all of a sudden you have more money than you need for it.

I have maxed my hotels and got enough bonuses to get neat little editions in each hotel by meeting my goals. Didn't spend a dime on those. I am looking forward to their next update.",5,2,1.2.0

Additionally do the event hotels get easier as a free to play later or ar the event hotels sumthing you have to buy to do well in I am asking because I completed less than 1 percent of the first star.,3,2,1.4.0
A Google user,This is my first (and probably only time) giving an idle game a 5 star review. The game is challenging yet completeable. Also the key asset of not ads makes the game enjoyable but not dull and boring.

Zepdog,"I would give more stars but there is a severe Limited playability. Even though they have a continual weekly hotel to play, it is not only the same hotel over and over, but they lock the ability to build any of the Presidential Suites.

A Google user,"Can be fun at times, has a slow startup. A few critiques: guests should leave the hotel at times, perhaps a visible mall or store.

A Google user,The game is good! Though I paid for no ads. My only issue is that the booster pack only lasts for ONE event and won't carry over to the next.

I love all codigames they are well made and fun to play thankyou for making them",5,2,1.8.4
A Google user,"It's very interesting, at times it can be a little bit overwhelming how slow it is to get cash especially when you have to keep it high enough to pay off all the workers and stuff. Overall very realistic and smooth though if you know how to use the bonuses with the ads.",4,2,1.1.1
A Google user,"Review edited. I've completed all 5 hotels only to have the app updated and find another hotel that's on an event, and they only gave you 48 hours to build up a minimum of $10,000,000 to get 1 star __ And per usual they charge extortionate amount of ¡ê10.49 to help you achieve what's required.. now I don't mind paying real money but only if the prices was half the amount they ask for like ¡ê5. Further more they don't give enough money to start off with and the game is very slow and very tedious",1,2,1.4.0
Suzanne Goodfellow (Suz),Its a little slow loading the firdt time but everything else is great! Lots to do. You dont get money fadt but steady like a real hotel. You must be smart on uogrades to make a profit. I wish there were other ways to make extra money besides ads but I understand tjis is the developers only source of income.,5,2,1.8.4
A Google user,"A fantastic game to pass the time! I love it. I absolutely love it. My only issue is the Event Hotel: It claims you can ""win"" managers, but I can't seem to win them no matter what. The only way I can see you ""winning"" them is if you pay for the boost pack. So that's a scam. But I still love the game. __",4,2,1.7.1
A Google user,"mm...half finished game..the guests are like zombies, eat at the same time and do things at the same time. was expecting something like the crazy hosptial but instead, just upgrade and upgrading the same rooms...there are tables all over the restaurant and bar but people just line up...also one guy can only serve two people thats just strange..very poor setting. again half done and all advs",2,2,1.2.1
A Google user,An easy game to do whilst needing a distraction. You don't need to purchase to play either which I love! The purchases are bonuses and may help but you can keep playing without. Most games aren't like that. I really appreciate this.,5,2,1.5.0
Anna Vrublevski,"HORRIBLE - more like AD EMPIRE - can't even play bc it freezes on a grey screen.. how is the prison one so much better in setup and quality when this has the same creator yet (imo) a better concept ?? Kept pressing back from the grey screen bc there was no other option and nothing happens, why do I have to restart the whole app every time I play??? Also I click the ads to double the amount earned and it doesn't ever work.... #fraudulent",1,2,1.8.2
A Google user,"Love the game! However, after the 4th hotel. nothing :( I was bummed out that there wasn't more content. The last hotel seemed to me, rushed a bit. The furniture didn't match well when in final upgrade.. Just looked thrown together compared to the 2nd & 3rd hotel! Otherwise, Was fun to play while it lasted! Definitely needs more content and good content, not lazy content! - J_PIT_R",4,2,1.2.1
Rushaan,"It is a very good time killer. I love how the game takes into account almost everything a real hotel must have. Adverts are not particularly annoying because they don't just pop up and only appear it you choose to watch it. It is ok to watch a few videos ina day to earn profits and stuff. Also a few rooms that were occupied whenip I left the game were sitting free when I can back, so pls fix this. Other than that it is very good game. Pls developers add some 3d camera for cool pov's pleaseeeeee",5,2,
A Google user,"The app needs you to look at adds to have a stable hotel at the beginning but it's so addictive and chill to have in your hand as you watch youtube/slow movies. Would love if getting a new hotel would benefit from the ones before. Now at the last hotels it's like looking at the same gameplay but slower progress speed. Love the design, details and overall feel. Some changes would make this my favourite app",4,2,1.7.1
A Google user,"A very good game, but the offline time is very small. It will be great if i could have the 10 hours upgrade free please. I play all your games since few years and i liked all of them. I think this one is the best one, but like all your games the offline is too short and we need to watch a lot of ads to earn some money, and I think I gave already watched enough ads. Please let me have Lord Wilton upgrade for free to improve my game experience. ____",3,2,1.2.2
A Google user,"It's a time killer game, but unfortunately I can't give this game more than 3 stars because I did not gain any money even I already watched some videos. Please fix this, because playing videos also takes time and data. Also, I just wondering if we can transfer some money to the other hotel's account. It'll be great.",4,2,1.3.1
A Google user,Love the game iv been playing it for 2 weeks and just finished santas shelter! Really really hope theres more levels in the near future!!!!!!. Yes lots of adverts but they do help but can be slighly annoying. I have only spent ¡ê10 in the game to get the offline manager which really does help with iver x2 or 30 gems for x3....,5,2,1.2.1
A Google user,Really fun game so far. Sometimes the actions of the maids glitches out. Main thing that I think ruins this for me is that you cant use money from old fully developed hotels toward new hotels. Maybe just allow a certain amount to be used or have to spend coins to use the money depending on the amount. Will change rating if fixed.,1,2,1.2.1
A Google user,"I think I have played all of the Codi games and others like it but this is more than an idle game. You do not just gain money, you have to hire staff and pay their wages otherwise they will leave. You also cannot just upgrade at your leisure as you also need to build generators for electrical power to run the upgrades. I payed money to remove ads for rewards so I get instant rewards which is more value for money than some modern AAA games. They also keep producing content. I recomend it.",4,2,1.2.0
Nick Kirkham,"Are they making another level after little Camelot? A new level hasn't been added I'm quite some time. I love it. I've neary finished the last level __. Also when upgrading a room or entertainment area, the option to upgrade all thing by 1 level at once would be useful as suggested by another player in the comments",5,2,1.8.4
A Google user,"A very good game. A little heavy on the ads side, but at least watching ads in this game helps you and you are not forced to. The one downside would be the very expensive costs of permanent upgrades.",4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,So disappointed with this game if you want to progress past the second hotel you have to spend real money could have been a fun time filler as it is it's a demo with 2 levels and even if you bother to spend money to unlock the rest it's only 4 levels altogether I have completed the first 2 hotels and will now uninstall because the game won't let you progress past this point I was enjoying the game until I realised this real shame,1,2,1.2.1
Okamifan1 Productions,"Much better than other trash management games like Civ, Sim City, and basically anything by Kairosoft. All of which are too hard, and boring af. In fact unlike that trash it's actually good. One of two good management games. (The other being Recettear for PC). Original review: Too hard... Seriously can people PLEASE stop making business or city management games. They are all boring, and too hard. Heck this, Civ, Sim City, and basically anything by Kairosoft are all trash games that are boring.",5,2,1.7.3
A Google user,"Really enjoyable game however there are a couple of things that could be improved. (1) To be able to get to 5 stars on a hotel so you can move to the 3rd one. I've been playing for ages now & only managed to make 4 stars on 2 hotels, (2) Be able to use the money you make from one hotel on another as you can the gems.",5,2,1.7.1
Lethia Games,"The game is good but they're some things to be considered: special services (marketing, no ads, general manager) are so expensive. Always limited power. High expensive on chef and bartender. Sometimes the housekeeping are jot doing their job, expecially on instant night. Low tips. Game is not giving me the stars for a new hotel.",3,2,1.7.1
tobb 27,"Love this game and all your others, payed money I like it so much,, just wondering if you guys could make a better viewing system,, sort of like a birds eye view? It's hard to see where I need to progress, or maybe a highlighted function.. just an idea is all.. anyway you makers are great!",5,2,1.8.1
Constance Truggle,"Great gameplay! I really enjoy having to choose what I can and can't afford to increase my revenue. I purchased the dog for no more ads, which is great and well worth the $10. My only problem is there aren't enough hotels. I've maxed out all my hotels and there are no more to build and maintain.",4,2,1.7.2
A Google user,I love the idle games by codigames until recently. 90% of the time I click on anything to watch ads and get more money or coins the video doesn't load and goes away and I don't get any reward. It's very frustrating when I'm willing to watch ads but don't get anything for them.,2,2,1.2.1
A Google user,"Best idle game from this developer of their idle series (hotel, gym, etc). I was actually able to ""beat"" this one too! Other games in the idel series from codi grew monotonous and felt like they just dragged on. Hope they will release more levels and also fix, what I feel, are a few bugs. Couple of the higher hotels not everyone can eat due to the line as well as an entire service is wasted because people are checking in and out. All and all great game!",5,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"This game is one of the best if you've been looking to itch the scratch of needing a managerial game, like I did! It's fun and simple, all the steps are explained and the levels are challenging but not game quittingly so. Definitely recommend!",5,2,1.1.1
Happy Doge Gaming,"Extremely fun, but it's kind of hard to gain money... but I like that the VIP customer gives a lot of money. It's a nice touch. Though, continuing, you have to wait at least a minute before you get money. Therefore it's hard to get stars to get a new hotel, but the game itself makes up for it. Fun game :D",4,2,1.7.3
Loretta Monosso,You should make it to where we have a choice to choose whether or not we want a bar or a double room..ect.. and I think we need to update the decor also with choices.. but all in all its a good concept.. take this game and just make it better with choices better styles thank you and now ! I can't get the money to work for me !! And I will Not spend money to play!!so off to another game!!,2,2,2.3.3
A Google user,"This game is a lot of fun. I like how you can watch ads to get bonuses that in other games you'd likely have to pay money for. It's not play to win, which is awesome, and the game is simple. You've got a goal to build towards, which I love, and I think the artistic style of the game is fun and cute.",5,2,1.1.1
Lavanya Ambalkar,"Other idle games by codigames such as the university one (that is the best) and the law firm one are much better than this game, solely for the fact that this game makes us watch too many ads. The money making process is too slow. So we do not have an option except to watch ads every 20 seconds. Highly annoying.",2,2,
A Google user,"This is the kind of idle game I can really get behind, each upgrade actually feels like an upgrade because something other than a number changes. It's really good and satisfying to see the hotel change as you continually upgrade your rooms and services.",5,2,1.4.2
A Google user,"I really enjoy the game, i feel more into it than other idle games. Its nice and slow so you're not practically completing that game in three days. Only down fall is the Real money prices for perks (gain bonuses and skip all ads, active after you close the app, and 2x cash in.) But is what is.",4,2,1.2.0
Krystina Alaniz,"Kinda fun, you pretty much just want to play to see all of the variances. The BIGGEST issue is that you have to literally click 90+ times to get a room to level to 100. Needs an options for x1, x5 purchase, x10 purchase, Max purchase.",2,2,1.8.1
A Google user,"This game is fun but has some issues. One main issue is when I switch to another app, turn off my phone,switch to another hotel, or exit the game I immediately lose half my customer. For example in the second hotel I have all the rooms but if I switch to the first hotel then go back to the second I have 7 rooms empty but when I left I had all the rooms filled. Some might say they leave well yes they do except sometimes it's like 2am when I leave and 4 am when I come back, same day.",3,2,1.3.1
A Google user,it's a really good idle game that's not unrealistically easy because you have to deal with expenses and not making a loss etc... my only issue is that there are only two hotels and I've fished them now. also there are no missions for the second hotel which meant I couldn't get gems.,5,2,0.3.1
Heidi Comer,Normally I would give it 5 stars but the ads you watch to get more money or skip to day aren't working properly. When I try to press the button to watch the ad it keeps acting like I never pressed it at all hut if I press the no thanks button it works perfectly fine. What kind of bs is that?? Please fix,3,2,1.7.2
A Google user,"Starts out slow and there's nothing to do with money after you've 5 _ a Hotel. Maybe add a currency exchange system that let's you trade money for gems, or buy permanent boosters, or a prestige system. If not, it's useless to revisit old hotels. All of their games seem to do the bare minimum despite all the potential.",2,2,1.2.0
A Google user,I was enjoying this game up to the third hotel but then it gets absolutely annoying. The hotels are supposed to close down after 2 hours of inactivity except for the hotel you are in. But from third hotel it closes down all of them and when I open the game back it takes me to the first hotel and I have to travel to the third one EVERY MORNING and EVERY EVENING when I play the game the most.,2,2,1.4.0
Tano Nicoletti,"Fun so far, I played a few games on my phone, fallout, castle clash, boom beach, paradise island. This is wonderful so far, however I have bought the add skip and the night manager. Not so much p2w but the micro transactions are amazing so up to you as a consumer. __ For scale.",5,2,1.8.1
Ron Westad,"Game stops after 6 hotels. Why? Seriously... Edit November 2020. They added another level. Now The Game Stops after 7 levels and it's been this way for quite a few months. I just don't get it, it's a wonderful game. Why do you encourage people to stop after finishing Seven Levels.",1,2,1.8.4
Charl Trenter,"I've really enjoyed this game, even the ads to double money earned, extra money aren't annoying, you have the option to not use them but 30 seconds isn't too long to wait for the reward. I have however completed all the hotels available so I'm hoping more will come soon __",5,2,2.3.3
A Google user,Awesome game in the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that occasionally when you hit to get an ad to say double the amount of money that you get from something it'll freeze and then restart the app and you'll have to do it all over again but other than that occasional glitch it's great so recommending it,4,2,1.4.0
A Google user,Great interactive gameplay. Nice graphics and storyline. Not much on earning moneys. But still good cause you need to spend time in playing. Ads is also good since it helps in the collections of money. Hope their will be a control in the speed of the game time. So far the game is good and fun to play.keep up the good work.,5,2,1.2.0
Stephanie Grant,"Very buggy game play. I constantly have to force stop the game in order to play the ads. That eventually stopped working. It's too bad, but I enjoyed this game until the problems started. I will be uninstalling.",2,2,1.8.4
A Google user,This is a fun game to kill time unfortunately there is only a max of 5 hotels and onces you have gotten 5 stars on them all there is nothing left to do. Spent the 20 dollars to remove ads and get all the upgrades for free tho. Would love to see more hotels come into play.,5,2,1.3.1
Kayla Howard (kayybyye),It's a really fun game but all of the sudden no ads will load and you can't get extras then sometimes when adds do finally load you watch and still don't get the bonus. I have updated the app multiple times and still have the same problem.,2,2,2.4
Rhahadian Bima Saputra,"Edit: not gonna lie even there are some bugs, I still decided to finish the game. Great idle game, but there is so annoying ""establish connection"" bug which make u cannot claim a quest and have to restart the game. (In my case I cant pick x3 income with gem) and the hotel is not updated yet so u dont have a reason to play this game anymore after u finish the last hotel.",5,2,2.4
A Google user,"I like this game so far, it's pretty addicting. I like that I can leave and it's still making money for me while I go about my everyday life. I also like the fact that it's very in depth about how things actually work in a hotel, I just wish that you had some kind of minigame to help earn more money or possibly a way to exchange points earned for in game cash which would also help alleviate wait time and give the player something more to do besides just watch.",4,2,1.3.0
Doe Gray,Your game is very adcentric and often ads are not available. The game would benefit greatly from a short term no ad purchase option like no ads for a week for a dollar. It is impossible to get any prize from an event without the ads but they have been unavailable for the last several hours,3,2,2.4
Ranique Martells,It's a great game certain things are too expensive especially when you are spending diamonds. Fix that being that it's the first hotel have the prices reasonable so we can upgrade quicker. Overall I love it. Btw let the investor bring in diamonds too not just cash.,4,2,1.7.2
A Google user,LOVE..LOVE the game.. very enjoyable. Also very smart about the ads.Making it the players decision if you want to watch an ad or not and making it profitable for the player to watch an add..I think because of that I have watched more ads and don't mind because it furthers the game..Well done..keep it up,4,2,1.1.1
A Google user,"Once done with the first hotel it's rather pointless to keep earning money and have nothing to spend it on. Half the time I click on the dancing guy to get extra money and there's no ad, or money. And if I leave the game for a short time and come back I notice with both hotels that just my single rooms are full and none of my double rooms are. They're clean and it's already night so I lose more than half my profits. But while watching the game all rooms are filled. Really enjoy add more hotels",3,2,1.1.1
A Google user,"One of my favorite games, After resetting my phone I've installed it again and all of my progress got erased including my purchases, I approached them and they gave me everything I've purchased back!!! Great customer support!! It really shows that they care about the players. Waiting for new updates and more levels!!",5,2,1.3.0
A Google user,"I find it so hard to progress through this game, everything is so expensive! Why do you need batteries that cost so much?? I cannot add anything else until I've upgraded the power, it makes no sense! Another room is now 16,000! A bar is 8000! The income per guest is around 200, minus what the staff takes and you get painfully slow game play. Please adjust all the values!!",2,2,0.1.1
A Google user,It was really fun strategizing and running 1st hotel. The second hotel is hard but you can grow it. It is challenging and fun. You don't have to play boring match 3 games. It truly is a strategy game!!,5,2,1.1.1
Tiffany Dixon,"I love this game but as of the last few days it is no longer allowing me to purchase more cash using my gems. Half the time when I go to purchase cash it is in a foreign language, sometimes it won't let me scroll once I'm there, and sometimes when it does finally look normal I click to purchase and it does nothing. It also won't allow me to buy more gems. The app and. Y phone are fully updated.",2,2,2.3.3
Niko Golagat,"Ads, game freeze, more ads, bonus mission that's impossible to finish even the first goal. Graphic issue with the cleaners. WHAT CLEANERS ENTERS A ROOM WHILE THE CUSTOMER US TAKING A DUMP. This game has a lot of fixing up to do.",1,2,1.7.2
A Google user,"First are the ""pros."" The game art is beautiful, unique and fits well with this developers theme. The play style is also geared to be more challenging, you aren't their to just make money. Implementation of expenses and employee wages adds realism and depth into management of the gameplay. Then their are the ""cons."" I often find some of the AI tracking is flawed. Customers will just stand in the lobby as if they were in line for food or another service. The app will not close automatically.",3,2,1.2.1
A Google user,This game is awesome man. I just love the balance sheet and everything. I had to fire a couple of people in order to keep it up and and running which was funny__. But now you guys should make it to where people can get robbed and we can hire police staff I mean I absolutely love this game im on the Stanley property now. Its really cool. I appreciate the amount of detail you guys put into this game. I seriously hope you guys make it to where you can do police reports and all.,5,2,1.2.0
Matthew Jed V. Denubo (MJ),"Yup, this game has a really nice sountrack, good voicelines, and good animations for me to enjoy. My experience in this game is really exellent; the ads doesn't annoy me at all so I'll rate it 5-stars. Maybe one day, this game will be popular for Tycoon lovers. I've been waiting for this game for a long time and little by little, I got quite addicted playing this game, so I'll share this with my friends and family. Thanks.",5,2,2.4
Lily Drozd,"It's really fun to play although when I try to watch ads for money or 2x income, the ads won't load and then the game freezes. It's so frustrating! Please fix it!",3,2,2.1
A Google user,This game could be really fun but the amount of adds you need to watch to get money is kind of ridiculous. The worst part is you have to continuously play the game or pay $10.99 real cash to make money at the hotel while not playing the game. It's like they are trying to force you to want to spend money on the game but the reality is the game is not fun enough to even consider spending any money.,2,2,1.7.1
A Google user,I completed the 2 Hotels that you have to do but there are only 2. There weren't anymore hotels for me to complete so I removed the game. The game is difficult but fun to play. Good game just add more hotels and as another review suggested combine the money from both hotels into one account.,4,2,
A Google user,"Its great but, it can be difficult and it takes time. The only problem I have is when I play for too long I try to like get time 2x profits by watching videos but it brings me back to the game with nothing but other than that no problem here!",5,2,1.1.1
Dee Sheets,"Ran out of hotels. All hotels are. Completed. I was playing it on the weekends after completing all the hotels but then I got bored. Housekeeping takes too long. Visitors arrive late and no where to get food. Perhaps players should adjust timing for food, bar. Etc. Maybe make the hotels where you can select colors of walls and floors? Possibly be able to remodel hotel or rooms once completed? Maybe developers can minimize game download by game retrieving part of the program online?",5,2,1.7.1
A Google user,So I love these types of games but honestly THE ADS! It's like you could dish out $10-25$ to avoid them and get perks but then the game would run its self for the most part. You would be it in 2-5 days if you pay. And if you dont pay then more then 50% of the time your running ads just to be able to interact with the game. Great concept but as always just a imbalanced game with money grubbing developers.,2,2,1.2.1
A Google user,"Its a really great game and a fantastic way to kill time, I just wish the progression was abit faster, I seem to need to stop playing for a few hours just to earn enough money to continue the game, I get that its idle but yknow Id like to spend a little more time actually playing it haha",4,2,1.1.1
A Google user,"Fun and relaxing hotel management Sim. Great graphics as well as an easy to use UI. The game doesn't overload you with ads, and the rewards from them and challenges are worth doing.",5,2,1.1.1
A Google user,i have been playing this game for a week now. and it does not dissapoint it is a wonderfull game and i just cannot leave it!. it is not hard it is very satisfying and i think anyone could try it. it never forces you to whatch adds you can choose to for currency. i would not change anything if i could.,5,2,1.3.0
Gabriella Gregson,Was pretty great to play while I did. Engaging and fun..wish the money could be used across all hotels kinda pointless to have hotels earning tons of money and nothing to use the money on at them then it just builds up. Eventually got the the point of tired with the game but was great until then.,3,2,1.7.2
LaToya Matson,I love the game but I despise how I literally spend 90 percent of my time watching ads and 5 percent of the time waiting on it to load. Which leaves me with a sad 5 percentage of ACTUALLY playing. The concept is awesome!!! I adore all Idle games. Just cut out the ads a little.,4,2,1.8.1
Megan Arvin,"The game is a lot of fun, but there are a lot of ads if you dont want to spend money for the manager.

A Google user,"I was enjoying it until I found something rather stupid and game breaking, apparently when I was waiting for the game to give me another chair that costed diamonds, I closed the game and went back into the game only to find not only that I didn't get the chair but also that it consumed the diamonds as well so unless you fix that issue, I may consider changing my rating to either a 4 or 5 depending on how the game is.",1,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Please add more hotels. I already achieved 5 stars for all hotels. It will be great if we can keep upgrading things at each hotel. This is as the hotel where I have reached 5 stars, the money keeps on coming in, but I have no way of spending them. Love the game though.",4,2,1.2.2
Eislek Danish,"I like this game. But the fact that its so hard to progress to the next hotel is unfortunate.

Ash Miller,"Starting off with 4 stars because the devs are clearly very responsive/actually trying to make a good game. I'll update it as I play. Update: this game is great, I'm having a ton of fun to it. Ads also give genuinely helpful benefits, which is nice. Updated to 5 stars.",5,2,2.7
Rob Bailey,"Do not spend money! It's been well over a year with no updates or new hotels. When I spoke with customer service, they said their timeline was to produce a new hotel every couple months. I wasted a bunch of money on a game with very few levels and zero updates. It's fun, but you'll complete everything within a few days. Since the developers aren't paying attention to their product, it's not worth your time or money.",1,2,2.6.1
Therisa Wheatley,This game is so awesome that I have completed it. I am waiting for more hotels to be added. I keep checking backing to see if they add more permanent hotels but they haven't. With all the idle games out there this one is my favorite. They just need to keep adding hotels. Other games have hundreds of levels. Why can't this one?,5,2,1.8.4
Adam Peregoy,Great overall free to played game. There are a few bugs with the investor and I had an issue with some of the cleaning staff staying in a room that bugged me but I just reloaded the game and it went back to normal.,5,2,1.9.9

Also there's something buggy going on with hiring, even if I only have one person hired for the job I'm paying for three? Okay idle game but honestly really boring after a minute, there's nothing to do to improve idling except idle overnight and upgrade like one thing.",3,2,1.2.2
A Google user,I was not able to loud into the game. The game only said error 4 and to contact the makers of the game. I don't have time to contact the makers because I am on a tight schedule. I was going to record it for YouTube on my channel. But it seems that the game won't start. I am sorry for the vary low rating but it would not work. So I gave it one star. If I had the time to figure out how to fix it I would. But sadly I have a tight YouTube Schedule as I said.,1,2,1.2.2
Louise K,Nothing but problems since the update. Had been really enjoying the game till that point but it is impossible to complete the Codi Resort challenges without the ads which now simply won't load. If not fixed in the next few days I will be uninstalling.,1,2,1.9.7
A Google user,"The game is good. All is balanced, just a little bug with the wagers of the bartenders. It said their wagers are 100 but when I hire its goes to 200 just like the chefs. Its just a little bug not big of a deal but please fix. The win-win ads are perfect. Good game. Please make more games like this.",5,2,1.2.0
Helen Thain,"Great little game that you can fill up some spare time in and come back to as and when but don't need to keep being told when the hotel closes. Event hotel is impossible to get far in so never going to gain a manager.... ridiculous idea only for those with nothing to do all day so I stick to own hotel. Also rooms should not vacate just because you went to visit another hotel... full when left, mostly empty when return a minute or two later.... not fair play.",3,2,1.8.2
Jacob Carter,"I love this game man. Codi, I been with yall since the jump and haven't regretted my gaming experience. Only reason I put 4/5 stars and not a 5-Star, my game has completely stopped opening. It goes to loading screen and juat sits there. I tried restarting my phone with no luck (new S20). This game is amazing though, so I'm kind of disappointed.",4,2,1.8.4
rajeev garg,It's really fantastic game.... I like it so much because there is so much activities that we have to do with the game players.... And if there is no money so investor help us and invest the money in our hotel..... So there is no worry but there is no energy left after playing the game for a long time.... So that's needs to be informed,4,2,1.7.1
A Google user,"I've recently bought gems from billing carrier from my phone provider, but there isn't any increased from my gems in game!! I have emailed the screenshot tho for profing I'm not lying, there's still no reply __. And also everytime i quit the game, and back login again, my customer is disappeared! Before i closed the game all rooms is full, but when i login again, there was 3 free room. How is that happen???? Fix it!!! (Edit)wow my email has responded, and my gems are back+they give 20 more gem",3,2,1.2.0
A Google user,Great game it's really nice once your hotel comes together and you see people coming in and the hotel really comes alive. I do wish we could use the money we get from the previous hotels towards the one you're working on because they just pile up to that current hotel. Eventually I would like to see more hotels with different designs. 4 stars because I have a lot of money from my other hotels that I can't even use towards my newer hotel.,4,2,1.2.0
A Google user,"Don't earn enough money period. It is a REALLY slow game even watching ads for money boosts. You legit have be outside the game in order to get a decent chunk of money! Room prices make no sense at all in this game either, $30 for a comletely upgraded room per...3 hours...ish? I understand added that up would be a lot more but from a game perspective, it's just not enough.",2,2,1.3.1
Takura MS,I like the game but when you open a new hotel it's the hardest because income is low and it takes forever to get a good amount of income. I think being allowed to transfer VC from other hotels to new ones should be a thing. You would have more users download the app and play more hours,2,2,1.7.3
Thom Holderman,"Good idle game, but lately every time I go into the game 3 rooms are empty, I've even waited for them to fill, exited and then log right back in and they are empty again, housekeeping is fully built and staffed so it's not that, others have experienced the same, fix this bug please",2,2,1.8.4

A Google user,A bit slow if you dont watch adds but the only one that is useful to watch a ad for is the investors which is just to gain money to speed things alone. I enjoy just sitting down and playing it when I'm just relaxing.,4,2,1.1.1
Lesley W,"It was doing fine until this update. Now, it opens up to a hotel I haven't played since I finished it when I was working on the event. It has done that after the event but NOT DURING! Unfortunately I will be Uninstalling.",3,2,1.9.9
A Google user,"Edit: I find ""Dmitri the Russian"" offensive for my country and culture. Reduced opinion even more. Balance seems poor. Same things become progressively more expensive when you move to new hotel. Also, is there any same reason that I cannot transfer money between hotels, except make the game more difficult? Also, amount of ads is insane.",1,2,1.4.2
Marc Teitler,A good game but all the developers games I have played have a continuous error connecting to the server problem (even when I have no connection issues) and this affects game play. It's annoying as I have spent money on the game,2,2,1.8.4

Nick Ungureanu,"I love this game, it's the most captivating tycoon I've ever played, thank you for this game. I would like very much if I could use money from my other hotel to invest in the new one cause if you do anything for one hotel(100%) it's pretty much useless afterwards. Thank you again !",5,2,1.8.4
Nate Smith,I did give this game a 4 star before but after putting money into this game there is a glitch where the hotel takes almost all the profits and you can barely upgrade anything. If it's not fixed soon I'm going to uninstall the game and you won't get anymore money.,1,2,1.7.1
Leonard Royal,"The game keeps closing after I try to get money after I watch the ads it needs to be fixed or I will have no choice but to uninstall it because all the frustration that I don't need can you fix it I'm so frustrated with this game, I spent my money on this game I deleted this game and I'm telling everyone who is thinking about installing the game not to unless you like throwing your money away if I could give this game a lower rating I would give it less than zero DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY",1,2,2.7

Jay Zeigler,Very entertaining casual game. Graphics are cute and small details add to the fun. It was worth it for me to purchase the 'manager' that allows you to get the boosters without watching advertisements.,5,2,1.8.1
Jonathan rey,"Great tycoon game, i love it and there's plenty more ideas that can happen like a space hotel, wild west hotel, Japanese hotel, futuristic hotel, so many possibilities Codigames can create also perfect balance in earnings if you bought all charcter except the newest 2, but 10hours offline and just 2x income is perfect, cause other games are to fast completed if you pay for them but this game you need a lot of money and you don't get enough to play it out to fast so this game is enjoyable.",5,2,2.3.1
Vicki,"I liked this game and paid money into it until this past event (7/24/20). I paid for the VIP package and never got it. The money came off my card though. I sent email, got a reply asking for reciept, supplied it. Havent heard from anyone again nor saw it refunded, nor saw it in the game. Its been 5 days now. I wont be playing anymore games by this developer due to the this. Just wanted to make others aware...dont spend money with them! 8/5/20 Still nothing but a generic email answer.SMH!",1,2,1.8.3
Meredith Lilly,"The game is alot of fun but definitely wish there were more levels. Also the events are made to only be obtainable if you spend actual money, that needs to change.",3,2,1.7.4
A Google user,I've played this game non-stop for a couple days. I'm loving it so far...only issue I have is that the price of the payable perks is a bit high...like for the managers and stuff..but I can make due without them. Loving the game,5,2,1.1.1
A Google user,"I don't know why the rating for this game is 3.7*... Its brilliant... I've completed it. Got all rooms, staff and items. I cant wait for more levels, as I was a little shocked and dissapointed that there was only one hotel. Its such a nice, calm, relaxing stratagy game. More please!",5,2,0.1.1
Jen P,"Update: Raised my rating, as the updates have made challenges enjoyable. New hotels have also been added. __ ......................................... Loved this game.

A Google user,"I like the game, only problem: the timing for a lot of things is way out, I've got patrons turning up and the first thing they want to do is get food, but that's the exact time when the chef's go on break so I lose money for that, or my patrons then head down for tea, and the place isn't open yet and then they just go back to their rooms, there should be an option where I can decide when its open or closed because these things are ether highest earners atm and I'm not making any money.",3,2,1.2.1
A Google user,"Excellent game so far, only issue is i have upgraded everything i can so far at the beginning hotel and my quests wont update with the progress i have made so i cant actually do anything now other than watch the hotel, no option to do anything so after a few hours of playing im now stuck and still waiting for a reply from the support team",5,2,0.1.1
A Google user,"Edit: Just finished leveling up every hotel. 25 stars. Waiting for more to continue. Great time killer. The only thing is, I wish you didnt have to start all the way over with like no money at each new hotel.. these are all my businesses right? So how come I have to use seperate bank accounts for each hotel? Makes no sense.. otherwise 5 stars",4,2,1.3.1
Jocelyn McWhorter,"This is ridiculous. I opened the app and let it load for at least 15 minutes. But it never loaded. Restarted my phone and uninstalled the app, but I reopened it and yet, nothing. I am typically a patient person, but this game made them run way to this.",1,2,1.8.4
Kailey Enns,Its fun but but if you dont upgrade things I the right order it can really impede your progress. I did not know there was a battery I needed to upgrade . . . Maybe I missed the msg but it stopped my progress for 2 days as I waited for enough money to upgrade it as I had no energy for a geny.,4,2,1.7.3
Yasemin Maras,"I think this game is amazing! One thing to make it better would be able to transfer money from different hotel. That way we could upgrade low stared hotel, but other than that I love this game and I recommend everyone to try it.",5,2,1.8.3
Wesley Harris,Fun and addictive! It's been awhile since I've found a good tycoon builder type game. There are a lot of ads but the 10.99 upgrade to remove the ads is 100% worth it.,5,2,1.8
Wojciech Bednarczyk,The time you are in the game you are spending 50% of the time playing and 50% watching adverts. It's an interesting game but how all mobile apps are designed its just a terrible experience. You loose interest in a game even if the game os good,1,2,1.8.4
A Google user,Loving the game at the moment but I've got three of the same quest but I dont know what it is as it shows up in a different language not English like everything else in the game. Is it meant to be like that or can I change it or is it a problem with the game I dont know. Also is it possible to send funds from one hotel to another? Thanks for the great game,4,2,0.3.1
Abhirup mitra,There are lot of bugs.. the dancinh man comes but when i click on play videos sometimes it does not work at all and I have to close the game and reopen . Please fix this ASAP. And is there way we can tranafer the money amount between 2-3 hotels ? It not please update it in your next update as it will be more helpful to play this games,2,2,1.7.2
Cristina Luthi,It's a fun game but unfortunately I can't opt out of the download for the upgraded version of the game and have no storage on my phone to download it. I have only had the game for a couple of days (it was great the way it was) and it's already wanting me to upgrade so I'm assuming there will be many more throughout time so it's not even worth trying to make room for it in my storage. I will be deleting this game.,2,2,1.9.95
A Google user,Hey there I installed this game yesterday and after playing it for a while there was an option for buying the general manager of the game. On screen it showed only 13.52 rupees which i thought was not so expensive and i decided to go for it. After entering my card details the transaction was made of 920 rupees. I was not aware of the amount disbursed i am not willing to pay so. Kindly i request you to diburse the amount back to my account and i request you to do as soon as possible. Regards,1,2,1.3.1
Chris Lesniak,It would be 4 to 5 stars. Game kept freezing especially during events. Contacted support and they just said they would try to duplicate and didn't do anything for my lost time.,1,2,1.7.2
I. Peer Mohamed Khan,"This game's lovable and I am expecting the more of this. Your team could add more items related to their respective areas that could look more suitable in the upcoming hotels. You could start a franchise of world's best rated hotels in the game.

A Google user,"Very addictive in a good way :) However some things could do with improving: 1) Service room capacity - It makes literally no sense that things like restaurant, bar, cafe and other rooms with seating stand half empty whilst people queue and are sent away. My fully upgraded restaurant has like 6 chefs for 12 tables and half the tables are empty, this is super unrealistic!! 2) People should not be going in huge crowds to closed services.

A Google user,I finished weeks ago and nothing new except a ridiculous 2 day challe.ge that was a impossible to even come close to winning unless you spend money . I already spent $15.00 on it .. wish I could get my money back for that. No way was I going to spend even more money for something that only lasted 2 days.,1,2,1.4.0
Raina Egbert,Great game except every 5 minutes if not playing you get a notification saying your hotels are closed. That's not cool after all the time I put into the game and finding out I lost everything I did so aggravating watching to uninstall the game if it keeps happening,2,2,1.8.1

DJ_ 200,"The ads. But I am not giving 4 stars because this is a very good game. But I want new detail features. 1: We should be getting all the rooms possible mainly in the sea resort.2:there should be an auto mode when the hotel gets to 5_ the hotel is open 24¡Á7 and we should get all the money when we visit it. 3: again at 5 the hotel time should change like 1 hour would take more than 60 secs of 30 so that we can watch the customers use the services and use the TV like services.

A Google user,Fun game quite enjoyed playing it more than most of the other tycoon games I have played great work!

Gina Northcutt,This game is a great game and there aren't very many ads so It just gets better i like the kind of games that are super easy this game takes a lot of patience and when you don't play it you get lots of money in the game.

Brittany Czech,"First of all, I love this game! It is by far my favorite app-based game! That being said, I have a few critiques. More levels please. Customers should stop going to places that are closed. On the Arabian level, I can't pay my employees so they quit, but I have enough to hire new ones. Its like a weird payroll flaw. Lastly, I love the events. I wish they would occur every 10 days or so because the events always take place on the same days every week and I work those days. Again, I love this game!",5,2,2.0
Andrew Leonard,"Was fun. Now there are constant event hotels which are near impossible to succeed in unless one spends $11. As a previously paying customer, I'm done. The game is fun but I'm not spending constantly for this.",1,2,1.8.4
Sagar Patel,"I played more than 100+ games like this containt of arrangements, controls, routine etc... All other things are good but Ads in game is all time same which is irritated, and so long this problem is nit in other game.",2,2,1.9.91

Caroline New-Figueroa,I enjoy playing this game it was fun and relaxing for me I now finished all the levels so am going to need you guys to add more levels I don't like when they have the events cause I feel like I can never win them or get close to winning since it's such a short time. Still love this game,5,2,1.8.2
A Google user,"I really enjoy playing this game, I only have one recommendation, the extra stuff you offer to buy should be more reasonable to purchase. I think you would get much more purchases and have many more downloads. Ty for the fun game",5,2,1.1.1
noelle buckley,i like it its a good game but i knoticed when i had the adds if i wated to long to skip it dident give the reward and the prise to remove them is unresinable compaird to other game of 2.99 compaird to 14.99 also the money from the first hotell dosent carry over to the next which is annoying. so thats why a 3 of 5,3,2,2.4
Connie Matthews,There is nothing left to do. All hotels are done. Dropped down to a 1 star review because there is literally nothing else to do but wait for events to happen. It took 2 weeks to finish the whole game. And that is with sleeping and working too. Not going to use up memory space for a game I can't play anymore.,1,2,1.7.1
Shawn Haywood,"Good game always something to do or upgrade, but sometimes more often than not, I don't receive my rewards for watching ads. That's annoying,",3,2,1.9.97
A Google user,Loved the game but then you run out of hotels. The new hotel.. with nothing open no employees nothing it costs more to stay open than you make. Basically it's a no win and you cant even pay to fix it. I bought all the stuff for this game.. it had been fun.,1,2,1.7.1
Kevin Lopez,"0/5 STARS Useless after 5 star. The hotels don't make enough money to put up with the costs of rooms and the influx of customers... you lose money when you turn them away. Devs will justify it as a challenge but they're racking up those ad payments left and right.. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND.. not even to pass time Edit: ""more than 10 million players reached the last hotel.."" CAP AF lol",1,2,
Daniel Cross,"Very fun but I've had it for about a day now and it's started crashing almost every minute which really sucks because it was really fun, hopefully it can be fixed.",3,2,1.9.93

I will be uninstalling sadly as its not good wnough to want to put money into it",1,2,1.3.0
Zach Doughty,Over all a fun idle game but I really wish they would add a better way to upgrade stuff in the room like max upgrade so one button upgraded everything in the room that you can afford i really hate the laggy ness when upgrading every room individually and with hotels getting more rooms i don't know how much longer I will play since it takes for ever per room to upgrade everything,3,2,1.8.1

Shakea Roper,"Was good at first. I even payed money for things. Then it started making less money the more upgrades I bought in the game. Probably delete soon. When talking with support, Robert wanted to argue with me. Bad enough it takes days to get a response. Smh.",1,2,1.8.4
Ashley Sullivan,"Good pace of advancement within the game, not exploitative with your attention. Def worth the no-ad purchase. Ideal for those who prefer a tactile activity while zoning out. Can be very meditative.",5,2,1.9.7
A Google user,It is a fun game but I know they can make the game more better then what it is maybe they can turn this game into a full pc or consul game like Roller coaster tycoon or sim city or something it would be nice to have a real hotel game with all this new technology and stuff I'm sure they can come up with something to Bring a game like this to life or make a new hotel game come to life I hope you understand what I'm trying to say,4,2,1.2.0

A Google user,Really fun game! Keeps you drawn in and offers the perfect of challenging aspects with expenses as an idle clicker. Great game.,5,2,1.2.0
Emmanuel Sanchez (Emman),A good time killer. It does not spam you with ads and force you to use real money but it's optional if you want to progress faster.,5,2,1.7.4
A Google user,Its a great game wish it was a little easier to get money. The ad free version is 11.99 thats a bit much for any game but definitely this one.,4,2,1.1.1
barry plunkett,Seems like the events are siphoning time. I started the event less than 3 days ago u now gave only 2 hours left. I would plat more if we could reset the hotels and try them again. Once you max them all out there's no point playing any more. I'd give 5 stars if you stop syponing time and reset the hotels.,3,2,1.9.91

HOW TF AM I SUPPOS TO MAKE A PROFIT IF IT'S NOT ALLOWING ME TO ACCEPT ANY MONEY?? __",2,2,1.2.0
Gary Campbell,The reason why I gave this app 3 stars is because the guy Jean is telling you what todo and you have to wach the guy eat!

RandyEDee1,"Good game. Been playing for over 2 months and in my 5th hotel. To get bonuses you watch ads. This was ok, but lately has been freezing and not letting you play ads. Also, game has been freezing when trying to double profit ads on boot up. It has not let me start the game for 10 hours. Some ads are 10 seconds and some are 45 seconds for the same bonus. Overall fun and addictive games but the freezing is having me get ready to uninstall. This review was originally a 4 Star.",2,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"Way too addictive! Had to delete! Would have been better if you could transfer some money from already completed hotels to newly started hotels - like others have mentioned, there is nothing to do with hotels you've maxed out and the profits they earn. Also, a couple of times the videos haven't given the profits advertised, but that's not a big deal. Great game all considered!",5,1,
Heart,"Love it, one of my favorite idle games of all time- only complaints are how required the ads are to progress. Without watching ads on a regular basis the progress is almost nothing and it would be a far less enjoyable game, taking months to complete levels and achievements instead of days. I also want more hotel levels, but that's just because I beat the game! Overall super fun and satisfying.",4,1,
Ani Cheung,"Fun game and quite enjoyable at first. But the amount of money it takes to upgrade rooms and services start to seem disproportionate to how much increase in profits made. Also, the game has some glitches. Sometimes the video ads don't play properly making you miss opportunities for a cash increase. I've also been finding myself stuck in a room upgrade screen, or a pay for ad free screen, and unable to get out, making me restart the game. I finally got frustrated enough to stop playing.",3,1,
A Google user,"This game is simple, easy to play and doesn't require hafvesting coins. It's a cute game that is good for passing time and has a fun cartoony artwork. However it doesn't require any thought or planning, simply dump all your money into upgrades and you win,and there is no freedom to choose where things go or what is offered at you hotel. Over all it is a good pleasing game to distract you but could be so much better.",3,1,1.3.1
A Google user,"Pretty fun overall! I like the cute simple design style and after the tutorial gameplay is pretty intuitive. My main complaints are all in glitches. Often my game just freezes on the loading screen and I have to close out the app entirely to restart it. The game seems to want to make me watch ads very often, yet 3/4 times the 'ad' is just a black screen with no reward. The double money function after being away from the game still gives the original amount, not doubled. Etc.",3,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"Pretty good game and quite addicting. I think it could benefit from more diverse upgrade options, though. Also, maybe some semblance of intelligent movement in visitors and employees. It's frustrating to see visitors travel from one closed service to the next, or to see housekeeping take ridiculously inefficient routes to clean rooms.",4,1,1.7.1
A Google user,Was a challenging and fun game. Watching ads was an easy choice to get the additional bonus cash needed to advance. Then bonus ads slowly stopped working... click the link and it sends you back to the page with nothing. This makes it very frustrating. I enjoyed it until this started happening... now it's time to uninstall this game.,2,1,
A Google user,You definitely have to watch ads to make some game progress in the beginning or it'll be a slow slow progress for upgrades. Sometimes after watching the videos for money r X 2 money I don't get the reward. I have contacted them about this bug as of now 3 stars. And definitely need to fix hotel going from full to half full when u close out of app makes progressing even worst. Game has potential but drives u to watch ads.,3,1,1.4.2
A Google user,"Normally I don't mind ads in games, but you rely on viewing ads to gain money, boosts, more customers, etc so often that half of your time is spent watching them and not actually playing the game. It's almost the ads are a game mechanic. The game itself just isn't fun enough to make that worth it, mostly consisting of upgrade, wait for more money, upgrade, rinse and repeat.",2,1,
A Google user,"Fun and addictive game! But it glitches all the time. If you upgrade things it might not save, if you have a full hotel and exit out of the app for just one second you'll have 3 guests that have check out. If the VIP guest comes and you click on him to watch a video to get more coins it'll glitch and you won't get the coins. Its frustrating and you can invest time into this game and have nothing saved.",3,1,1.3.1
A Google user,This is an addictive idle game but it's loaded with problems. You have to watch way too many ads which won't even load half the time. You can miss big bonuses for this reason. It actually has a challenge aspect to it which I appreciated. Manage your money! My biggest issue is the inability to get my 9th star for the 3rd hotel. I've upgraded everything possible and spent all my gems on upgrades but still no 9th star...,3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"The setup and controls are great. The opening tutorial isnt to invasive and get you going pretty quick giving you exactly what you need to know. I'm having a blast playing. My only complaint is the cost of the unlocks. $10+ to go add free is ridiculous. I usually pay for add free on games I like, but I'm not paying that.",3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"The game has started working since the last time I tried to play it. It is a really different look on idle games because you have to manage your money because of the expenses. I did have to watch a few ads to keep up the balance, but now I can keep it up without the ads. It's a worthy experience if your looking for a time killer.",4,1,1.1.1
Mikhail Perminov,"Great game. Ads are never needed to progress, there are many hotels and many items to unlock. However, the Blue Crystal resort does not capitalize the r in resort like the other hotels and there is no period at the end of the description. It is just a simple annoyance, but makes the grammar inconsistent.",4,1,1.8.2
A Google user,"Have to admit, I'm pretty impressed. Most tycoons it's like, blah blah blah, watch ad watch ad, somehow earn Nonillions of dollars by just owning a business for a few days. This is at least a little bit different. You dont only make profit, and you have to pay your workers. It still gives me some trash tycoon vibes, with a bunch of ""optional but takes 1000x slower to get the money if you dont do it"" ads. It is still a great game though, and I recommend it.",4,1,1.6.0
A Google user,"I personally loved this game. It doesn't require a lot of time invested at one time, so I can just check back in with the game 2 or 3 times a day and get upgrades. My biggest complaint is that I finished all the hotels and have nothing else to build. But overall, one of the best tycoon games I've played. Fun, simple, and takes a little strategy instead of mindless clicks.",5,1,1.2.2
Lindsay Miner,"Fun with a few drawbacks. This game is super cute. Once you get over the first hump in the game it picks up. Took forever to earn enough money to upgrade stuff but once you do it gets faster. Lots of optional ads to earn more money, which I don't mind. Wish there was an option to fast forward but otherwise a fun game.",4,1,1.7.2
Kimberly L,"Half the time after watching an add for money the dancing man man that gives it to you will still be there dancing and you do not receive the money and cannot watch another add to receive further bonuses, same with the 2x, and taxi bonus. The only way to fix this is to close the app and reopen it, but when you do this you always loose customers. I will have all rooms booked come right back in and have 3 vacant rooms. These glitches make it hard and annoying to progress in the game.",4,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"Great, fun, addicting game. You get caught up in trying to build your hotel that you forget what time of day it is. The only draw back or complaint I have is that sometimes I do not get my rewards. The video will play for a short second and then go back to the game without giving me my reward. I would give this game a 5 star rating if this issue or bug is fixed!",4,1,1.2.0
Kyle Beyer,Great idle game. I enjoy playing it for probably a lot longer at a time than I should. Ads work and reward you correctly unlike some other games I play. The only issue I have is occasionally (rarely) the game seems to freeze up but its nothing a quick reset doesn't fix. Highly recommend if you enjoy idle and management games.,4,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"I can tell there was a lot of work put into the game. It shows! The game is addicting, but Holy Advertisements, Batman! I understand, though. They do offer the no advertisement benefit, but for a pretty steep price. However, there are very little, to no bugs and it I really do have fun playing the game. Great Job to everyone who was part of making this game!",5,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"This game is awesome and I was having a lot of fun playing it. Unfortunately after a day of playing it started occasionally freezing, forcing me to restart my phone. By the second day it froze seconds into the game and became completely unplayable. I tried restarting my phone, clearing the cache and the data, nothing helped.",2,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"I like the game, and when I got to the Stanley Resort it was super fun because of all the new things, and then when I got to The Blue Crystal Resort I became addicted because it was incredibly fun, but then I got to Santa's Shelter and was so disappointed. But I think they should make a new hotel that is like Great Wolf Lodge, or Kalahari where you can upgrade the hotel and you can upgrade the waterpark. That would be amazing.",4,1,1.2.1
Mike Laverty,"I love the game! A few suggestions though... Add an option to buy as many possible upgrades in a selected room/service. Maybe even, if you have enough coins a button to fully upgrade the room? After getting far enough my phone lags from everything going on and trying to upgrade constantly. The premium features should also be a bit cheaper. :)",4,1,1.7.1
A Google user,"The graphics are cute, and the potential is there. But unfortunately any fun is ruined by the scummy free to play model and it's clear this is just another cash grab. If you play free progress is slow and locked behind watching a ton of ads constantly. If you pay to remove the ads the game becomes boring, as half the features becomes useless and the game throws cash at you constantly. Playing free becomes a huge grind and if you pay the content evaporates quickly.",2,1,1.2.0
Vera Kagan,"Excellent game, no bugs or crashes at all. The graphics are clear and the little details for each room are fun! I love how the creators put in little touches such as one of the guests looks just like Heisenburg from ""Breaking Bad"" and two other guests I swear are from ""Pulp Fiction""!!! Definitely an A-1 game!",5,1,1.7.1
A Google user,I really like all the different ways to upgrade the hotel and how it effects everything. There's just too many ads. Watching one ad only gives you 10 min double income. You basically have to watch ads to progress. I don't mind watching ads but I watch more ads than actual gameplay.,2,1,1.1.1
Shelby Seadorf,"I really like this game. The only issue I have is, when I watch an add video for coins occassionally it won't give me the coins and goes all weird and won't let me watch ads on the game at all until I restart it and then when I restart some of my people left so I am making less profits and never got the coins for the ad I watched when it stopped working. Other then that I enjoy the game play.",3,1,1.7.2
lele khan,"Super annoying that you can only have so many chefs, or bartenders or whatever it be, working. because once the hotel is leveled up there's way too many people and the restaurant will stay open for hours making no money, because they've walked away. Also can't really get started at all without watching ads but that's whatever. Better than most Tycoon games still.",3,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Controls pretty straight forward. Graphics are good for an idle game. My only issue is not being able to take money from previous maxed out hotels and use them on newer/bigger hotels. Makes the game really slow. It would be nice to use all the other hotels income to improve the newer unlocked ones. Fix that and this game is all 5 stars.,4,1,1.6.0
M.K.,"It's a good idle game but some of the upgrades don't add up. For example, according to the description the fully upgraded double bed should be worth 165 dollars by itself. Yet my room only makes 54.21 an hour. I have a fully upgraded deluxe room in the event happening now that should be making 1081 based on the descriptions but it's only making 54.21. That makes no sense. The activity rooms reflect the actual description cost, like the restaurant. It's just really annoying.",4,1,3.1
Allison Baskins,"Ive had this for a couple weeks now and all of a sudden it has started to crash on me and close out on its own. When i watch adds for the investor, it doesnt give me the money.",1,1,3
Andrew Bronson,Well I started playing this game more and more now. Its actually really enjoyable!! And I got to the second hotel and im now unable to double my profits now when the ad guy pops up... it's just a constant load screen and never loads. I read another review just like this. Hopefully this can be fixed soon.,1,1,2.9
Ambrin Firfire,"A good game for keeping ur mind fresh n free n it doesn't even costs you money for buying things if ur are patient n calm u can earn money by just watching videos, and as the level increases the amount of money also increases by watching the the videos n that's a great point of this game by videos earn more n more money to run ur hotel n to make upgrades go for it....",4,1,3.1
Giezel,I love this game I used to play it all the time on ym old phone and it got crashed I just got reminded of it and now I am back. No changes and no adverts randomly.,5,1,3.1
Sungmin Yang,I completed this game. It was good but the ADs showed up that needs to click next 4 times. So when thst sort of AD came up. I stop playing game. Other than that. It's been great. I just hate article AD so much.,4,1,2.8
Jay Sheehan,Sometimes the ads freeze and don't have a way for you to close out of them and also sometimes while you're in the rooms or in the menus you can't get out of them and you have to reload the game until that's fixed for stars and yes the ads are heavy but that's what you have to do when you're a free player,4,1,2.8
Natalia Gonzalez,"I liked the game, good animation and good idea. But I want to say that I would like it more if there were issues with the guests, for bad service or any problem in their rooms. Maybe a little bit more complex. It would be also better if you can decide the style, colors, etc of the hotel, and it was a bit annoying when I change the hotel, the gains of the last hotel were lost. Maybe I earned a lot in the first hotel, but the second one will be more expensive.",4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"I like this new approach, feels much more in depth. However it feels far more advert heavy than previous games. Like it really pushes them on you in order to progress because the start of the game is soooooo slow to start up. Not to mention that in game purchases seem to more expensive, each upgrade is over ¡ê10. Not a chance in my book, way too expensive.",3,1,
baguette,"Everythings nice, the progression, the amount of things to explore and unlock and the fact that ads are optional which I love. But the few things that I don't like about this game is 1: the fact that hotels are basically nothing after it hits 5 star. 2: the event hotels are a joke, it's practically impossible to hit 1 star without ads or spending money which takes away from the awesome perk of having optional ads.",4,1,1.7.2
Shilpa Bhandari Poredi,"It's a great game don't get me wrong, but what I hate is that when I watch the add from the VIP guy with a boost on I never actually get money despite watching the ad. He promised 290k and 580k but when I watched the ad I got nothing. Is this a glitch? ( I had a 5 times boost on )",4,1,2.8
Chasity Morrow,My kids love this game so I decided to try it. I LOVE IT!!! My only issue is all the ads but it's okay.,4,1,3
A Google user,"It's quite a good little idle game, there's plenty to do when it comes to up keep and upgrades, plus with the various stages it's enough to keep you interested. My only issue would be for the premium upgrades could use less stars but I guess that's where the pay to play comes in, it doesn't impact the game you can still upgrade all rooms to 100% without them, that's why it still gets a 5 star otherwise I would have only have it a 4.",5,1,1.3.1
Aos RenAgAde,Good game but to progress you really need to be on the game all the time. As if you leave the game without the In game purchase. It stops collecting revinue and time only 2 hours after closing. Which is only a bad thing when you are trying to save up for the more expecive items and everything else has been done. I reccomed this to those with time to waste and a long battery life.,3,1,
A Google user,"I almost always on every game I play turn the audio off so I can listen to music or a podcast or something, so obviously did the same here. Watched an ad to get some money and when I got back the audio had come back despite setting still showing them off. Turned them on then off again. Watched another ad to get more money and when I came back the audio was back with the settings still off.",1,1,1.2.0
Roblox Candle,"It takes super long to upgrade stuf so it would be nice to add a button that says upgrade all or something like that because you can have 5m and Only spend 100k because you get bord from just clicking please add that-great game thanks,roblox candle",5,1,2.8
A Google user,Great gameplay. I used to play other games from this company too. Loved them. But this one is a little bit disappointing for me because it's almost impossible to move forward in the game because it's too slow unless you watch a lot of ads or pay actual money for their upgrades. Puts me off the game and prevents me from actually purchasing the upgrades,4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"The game looks interesting enough. However, I find that there are way too many videos and each video is at least half minute. You can pay $15 to get rid of the videos though. Think there are other in-app charges too which makes it too expensive for my preference. I would rather decide if I want to pay a reasonable price for a game after a free trial, and not have to deal with so many repetitive videos.",3,1,1.7.1
Seba Alnosour,"Cool game. I liked it there's no sudden pop up ads although you have to watch ads to get money for stupidly expensive upgrades. 2 stars because once you finish updating a hotel to the max it's starts making unusable profits it's such a waste considering following hotel are even more expensive. There's also an annoying thing, if you move between hotels most of your customers would disappear and you wont profit of the sudden unused rooms. Please fix this the game is one if the few idle fun games.",2,1,1.7.2
Ace Ques,I love this game there is so much to do and when you play this you never get bored I spend about 3-5 hours on this game! Also one thing I wish you could transfer money to your other hotels that would be awesome,5,1,2.8
Kerri Morvant,"I've waited long enough. I'll edit my review and change to 5 stars if you release new hotel by End of February. If not, im deleting app. It's been almost a year without new hotel added.",1,1,2.8
A Google user,"Super addictive, really great fun and great for killing some time, there are adds yes but these are optional if you want the extra cash to spend in the hotel. The graphics are fun and the missions not out of reach, it can take a while to save up but thats part and parcel. All in all a really great time killer.",5,1,
A Google user,"It's extremely slow to get started, building up money is very hard without watching ads. Still a good game despite that, however. As you progress in each location you'll hit a point where the profits start to come in quicker and the game becomes more fun from there.",4,1,1.5.0
Alex Banks,"After recent update, app crashes after about 5 minutes. Happens sooner if you're interacting with it lots",1,1,2.9
A Google user,"Uninstalled. The game was ok to play, Just like all the other tycoon/management games. However after watching an ad of my own choice, I came back to the main screen which said your hotel has been running for a few hours now. If you hire a general manager you can keep it running for another 10 hours. No indication that it was real money. Until I selected buy and lucky I don't have one tap to buy set anyhow, as I realised it was actually $17.00 about to be deducted. Very sneaky Not happy!",1,1,
Pira,"One of my favorite codigames, but I wish the game progress didn't get reset all the time. I even pay to play, yet I am expected to remember where I was at for the support team to get my progress back. At least kudos for actually having a responding support team. Also, I wish there was more updates. The weekend events could also have at least have a few rotating hotels, as it gets boring really quick with the same one over and over. Either way, with the ads paid to be removed, it is a great game.",3,1,1.9.7
A Google user,"It's a pretty decent game, I wish growth wasn't so dependent on watching ads. I've also had a glitch a few times where I'd watch an ad all the way through and still not the my money. Once it happened three times in a row and I had to restart the game to get it working again, which is pretty annoying.",3,1,1.3.1
A Google user,"the game itself was good but for me, once I got to the second hotel it started getting annoying because the math for my profits was off. At one point it started charging alot more for the daily wage then it shouldhave because i only had 3 staff and when i counted that was the it didn't work. It started doing the same for profits. I dont know if that's a one off bug or something else but it wasn't working right.",4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Very fun!! however, I've completed all the hotels and now I wish there were more... Also, for the event hotels, the achievements are really hard to achieve unless you pay or you constantly watch ads to double your profits. And theyre so boring because its the same hotel every time. its so dreary building up the same hotel again and again.",5,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"Basicly you have to watch the ads to make the game progresses. The bar and restaurant didn't make any sense since it can serve only 2 customers per chef/bartender. Also, their wage is 200 each and the revenue from restaurant and bar are way too small when compared to the cost. Only give 2 stars because of the graphics.",2,1,
A Google user,Love it so far! A more in depth tutorial would be nice. My housekeeping is always at a loss. Not sure why. Also you have to watch ads for currency. Everything is ad based it's ridiculous. And the ads lie about.how much they give you. Only worth playing if you don't mind watching a 30-45 second ad every 3 minutes,1,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"1. I love the graphis - they are so cute. But they need more degree of freedom in their movement. I like watching them but they all behave the same way. And the path is too long. It might be better to grow up speed a little bit or shorten the path btw utilities. 2. It's way too slow. Even though I paid top money for this, it' too slow to earn money. 3. Graphic is good but ppl like more details to it. There are too many blank spaces btw stuffs(chairs, tables, spa...). I enjoyed it a lot",4,1,1.3.1
Aaron Ritenour,You need to make more hotels so the game continues might want to think about designing games with alot more levels in the future before you release them to be played,1,1,2.8
Ta So,I like it but it has sooo many glitches. When i try to watch an ad to do somthing it either takes forever to load the option button to watch add or it want even play it at all and if it does i dont end up with my bonuses ie 2¡Ámoney or the VIP man. It also lags and take ages to swap between the hotel or upgrading thing. I know its not my internet as i have the theme park game too and it does not do it on there. PLEASE FIX as it is a good game i really wont to keep playing.,3,1,1.7.1
A Google user,I would've love the game. It's fun and it makes you think of budget and finance thingy. One thing is that the time's too fast but the customers/clients are too slow to walk. Sometimes they can't reach the destination open because it's already close. Can't imagine them walking for almost 2 hours to reach a close destination.,3,1,1.2.2
A Google user,"I love this game. Its challenging but weirdly calming thanks to the in game music. One downside is I just cant seem to get the game to start, its been stuck at the front loading page for more 5 minutes. Tried closing the app and restarting my phone. Still nothing. Didn't wanna uninstall coz I'm afraid of losing my progress.",2,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"It's a great concept game, however it takes way to long to save money being restricted to three rooms. You can't get enough customers in and out of the rooms to make a profit. Only way you can really get some money to do something is to watch the adds. Fun game, will give 5 stars when these problems are fixed",2,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"Good concept, slow progression. Takes forever to make a significant amount of money. The ad rewards aren't very impactful, and the real-money things are waaaaay overpriced. After a few days of playing & not making real progress, it got kinda old to go back & have to watch 4 videos to get something done.",3,1,1.3.1
A Google user,Reasonable game but unfortunately falls in with the pay to win mechanics of it's ilk. 2 of the 3 purchases in the game are over ¡ê10. A lot of devs nowadays seem to be following this trend too. I can't help but feel that a lower price of ¡ê3-4 would entice far more people to spend a bit of money but overpriced greediness seems to be the norm nowadays. A good game to play as a timewaster but expect to pay significant amounts or watch an endless torrent of ads to make any real progress. A shame.,3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,Good game but still bugs. This isn't really a real Idle game. It only keeps your hotel open for 2 hours. I'm on the second hotel and every time I leave and come back 3 rooms are empty. The ad videos to get bonus money works sometimes. But not all the time. So its taking longer for me to make money to upgrade my hotel.,3,1,1.2.0
Donggun Kim,"Okay, the whole game is like make money and upgrade your hotel until you get a 5 star.... Nothing so creative about it. You need to click moindlessly to upgrade your hotel to get more money. No possiblity to customize or creat your own hotel.. The fun part about Tycoon games is that you get to create your own but this game clearly lacks in it.. I don't recommend this game.",1,1,2.6.1
A Google user,"I LOVE this game! its so addicting but I just want MORE. Theres a lot to do and it kept me busy for quite a while but I'm nearing the end and it's kind of upsetting.

A Google user,"I want to enjoy the game, but it feels like I watch ads more often than playing the game. So far my main place of revenue in game is through watching the 'VIP' ads which most of the time don't even load and give rewards. Everything else provides so little revenue it takes so long to save up for upgrades.",3,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"It relies too much on ads that it frequently disrupts gameplay. I agree with the other comments that the profit from previous hotels should be brought to the succeeding ones, atleast half. It's fun at first but it just gets tiring from relying on ads just to get money. Without ads, gameplay progresses unbelievably slow.",3,1,
Chris James,"Great game love playing it. Just needs one extra option, rather than upgrading the individual items in the rooms, it needs an upgrade whole room button either one level whole room or full upgrade whole room or both options if possible. Its just so time consuming upgrading everything individually. Please add into the game",4,1,1.8.2
A Google user,Update: Contact received from the developers who could t reinstate my game progress but offered some gems and other rewards. Still had to redo both levels completely though so it was still frustrating. I do like the game idea though and await further levels. Still a glitch as missions I've completed are showing as incomplete. Work in progress,3,1,0.3.1

A Google user,"It's awesome. I like how it kills time when I need it to lol. Also, it's just super fun and I think it teaches you a lot. I just hate the housekeeper glitch.

Keeps happening though.",4,1,1.2.0
Ryne Lindquist,Decent game over all. But a couple things I have are the event hotel should either have a pool or casino added to give people more to do to make profits. The profits are really slow once you max everything out making getting 3 stars pretty difficult. Also need to add more regular hotels. I'm almost done with the Camelot hotel and after that might just have to get rid of the game since there won't be anything but events to do which would be pointless.,4,1,2.6.1
A Google user,"A fun experience and not too grindy which is a positive, however the quests/goals stopped working, not a big problem though, the game needs content, maxed out my hotel. The whole strategy with wages and decision making on when to upgrade and having enough money in the kitty is a welcome change. I would recommend.",4,1,0.1.1
A Google user,I've been playing now for a couple hours - yes it's addicting. A couple things noted: There's a lot of ads but most of them are short (15 seconds or less). The income multiplyer is only a max of 2 hours and you have to watch a lot of ads to fill it. I should be working but I can't put this game down!,4,1,1.3.0
Rohan Sharrock,Great game. Its very addictive but i gat a bug where it wont let me open the game anymore. Please fix this,5,1,2.8
A Google user,"A great game and thoroughly enjoyable. It would be great to manage staff better e.g. promote to more senior positions so they can complete tasks quicker or serve quicker, have the option to fire lazy workers and have the animation of them taking longer than others like laying on the bed, standing around watching tv. Think this would be quite funny to see. Having the chef's clean some days before their shift would be a nice little touch also.",5,1,1.3.1
Emma Warren,"Update: As an absolute fan, I have completed all 6 hotels, missing playing it. Please put more hotels to do. Thank you __ Love this game, so addictive. Good graphics, love the different hotels and the different locations. The dancing king makes me laugh as he looks different in each hotel, I think that was very clever idea. I am now on the last hotel and hope there is a new upgrade before I complete it. Thank you for a brilliant game __",5,1,1.7.1
Mohamad Awada,"Pretty awesome game. It us pretty hard to earn an amount that you can continuously spend and use to upgrade without watching the ads offered by special patrons. Hard to get going, but once you get up there, it really is a great game!",4,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"The game is pretty straight forward you earn money and move forward to build bigger hotels etc. Postives about the game - simple game instruction - objectives easy to understand and obtain Negatives about the game - Money that is earn from one hotel/resort you can't transfer to other resorts when opening it. So you start off with little to no money again. Which isn't realistic if you have one hotel making 50 k or something - Ads too many ads, and to get rid of the ads it's like 15 dollars.",4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,Fun idle game. A little more strategic than the norm. My only gripe is I don't get the cash boost sometimes cause the ad doesn't really play. It's just a pop up for a few seconds and nothing happens. When I close out of it the guy walks away and I never get my reward.,3,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"Why is it so slow! __ I played different models from this developer, some were so much better than this. Well the cooldowns of everythings are slow, way too slow to get improvement. Advertisements are everywhere and they are the majority things that speed up actions and times. Why? 20-50 seconds of Ads are time consuming, pretty much the same ads everytimes. ______",2,1,
Tatjana Zubler,Soo I love the game. Very addictive. Paying for no ads is a bit expensive imo. It looks great and I love the little details like Kill Bill and John Wick as guests. Still..it needs an upgrade to max for the rooms button. It takes waaaaaay to long at some point to upgrade like 50 rooms. PLEASE IMPLEMENT!,3,1,1.8.3
A Google user,"Played for a month , game is interesting and we do complete levels but after a month game seems monotonous. Please could you bring new types of challenges in this games with difficulty level. Eg. Now lets for a resort we give player option to cook variety of food and earn money. Little depper level of cooking complexity and so on for room decoration and employ timing changes. This will be something different from regular resort/hotel running which will keep us entertaining. Overall awesum game.",4,1,1.6.0
A Google user,Its a really fun game but some times you find yourself a bit board. Its really hard to get the second hotal. If you do get this game my edvice is to save up all your money because youll look back and think i wish i saved my money. I love the game its easy to get money and items when there not on high levals. Get the ar erley and rooms later. Enjoy playing remeber look on the bright side and dont get courght up with drama.,4,1,1.4.2
A Google user,"I like the game. But it is getting pretty annoying watching ads that dont work. Like the screen goes black then resumes game with no money like promised for watching. Also if I exit the app while the hotel has full occupancy, I'll reload the app immediately to find only two single bed rooms have people. Please fix.",3,1,1.1.1
A Google user,Sometimes gives ads sometimes doesnt game progresses very slow after first hotel i would buy the instant ad thing but $11 is way to much $2 would be reasonable unless it transfers between every game you make but i dont know and dont feel like finding out overall decent game but in app purchases overpriced like every other game and it relies on ads to progress at decent rate like every other game. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone unless you like ads,2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Simple game with incredible graphics. Great fun and its challenging, unlike other idle games. No forced ads, you choose. Downside is sometimes you have to watch ads to get anywhere. And it also glitches if the ad is dodgy. When it kicks you out it only has half the rooms occupied.",3,1,
A Google user,"I've played many of the other Idle Tycoon games and this one seems to be most in-depth, while still allowing for the game to operate in the background and stay under the Idle umbrella. Costs $10 get rid of all ads and unlock all, otherwise ad-blocked, bonuses. .. considering it.",5,1,1.1.1
A Google user,It is a fun game but I feel you have to watch a ton of ads to get anywhere. Increasing the profit booster to 20mins per vid rather than 10 would be more understandable. Also it is a shame the money on hotels you have finished can't be tied over to other hotels. You could make the other hotels more expensive cost wise to counter it.,4,1,1.7.1
Liinaa A,"Kinda fun and addictive game.. but its annoying.. if you leave one hotel with full occupancy for few seconds to go to another hotel, then come back.. that hotel will now have 2 or 3 rooms free.. although a few seconds ago it was full. Its frustrating because it slows your progress down unless you have the game open 24/7",3,1,1.7.1
Christie Rubio,"Fun, addicting game. I enjoy how it's easy to make progress while still being challenging enough to take some time to complete the game. Customer service is impeccable and reponded extremely quickly! I've played multiple games Codigames and they're all great.",5,1,1.9.93
A Google user,"I really enjoy this game and it's fun to see the different upgrades and hotels. However, my other 5 star hotels are now making copious amounts of money and i have nothing to buy with it! Would be nice if I could transfer limited amounts of money per day or something to my other up and coming hotels.",3,1,1.4.2
Katie Wohldmann,"I used to like playing this game but now when I set my ad option to social network ads, I've noticed when I play the game later that it resets it back to newspaper advertising. So I don't get as many customers as I could, therefore taking much longer to level up. So I am going to uninstall this game.",1,1,
A Google user,"Its a nice fun game, just everything is way to damn expensive and you dont earn any money it seems like. After awhile it becomes impossible to keep upgrading. I been playing for a couple weeks and only have 4 rooms the bar and restaurant. Constantly dont have power and have way to many customers and not enough rooms due to lack of money",3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,A unique take on idle business games that goes well beyond the other ones. I'm glad I gave it a try. The only issue is the permanent buffs are way to expensive for each one. Nock the price down to a third and I'd consider sending the money your way.,5,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Uninstalled. 30% play time and 70% advertisement watching. Your profit only rises if you opted to watch their ads. Hotel will not earn money while offline and customers only pay small amounts. Plus, upgrades are expensive. It is hard to keep the money up. It also consumes too much data.",2,1,1.2.2
Donna Fraser,"It is a fun game to play, but once you open and complete all the hotels there is pretty much no point playing. Would love it if it had the opportunity to reset the hotels but keep the people earned from the resort events. (P.S resort events would be nice if there was more to build eg, pools etc)",4,1,1.8.4
A Google user,"Enjoy playing this game a lot. I never had trouble with it up until I unlocked the Blue Crystal Resort. Every single time I log into the game, only 2 out of the 4 bedrooms are booked out amd that means that my expenses are high and I only recieve minimum profit. I hired two chefs in order to serve 4 people and the rest of the 4 waits to be order without any problem, but now it's only a waste of money since there are only 4 guests whem I'm offline.... PLEASE FIX THAT",3,1,1.2.0
La La Lo-Fi Lover,Hard from the start and never gets easier. Wish they gave power ups away after failing so many times instead of the option to purchase only.. its not fun to log in 3 times a day just fail over and over. Im about to Uninstall it -.- too bad. It was fun..,2,1,1.8.4
A Google user,"Game is fun, but once you 5star a hotel, the money doesn't transfer to another hotel, so you're just racking up cash that you can't do anything with, but you have to 5star the hotel to open a new one anyway. Just seems kinda redundant. There should be a way to transfer funds or something. Gems, however, are used for all hotels, so those run our very quickly. Gets rather frustrating.",3,1,
A Google user,Very fun time-passing game. The graphics are quirky and fun while also being easy on the eyes. Would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys any tycoon-based games. While you don't have the freedom to build everything custom what you do have is still fun.,5,1,1.3.1
A Google user,"a really good game, great challenges, however money dwindles fast and is hard to build up quickly. it adds to the challenge but can be a bit frustrating sometimes, all round a great time passer you'll find yourself investing in!",4,1,1.2.2
Jayne Mooney,Good game. Enjoyable. Wish you could do more than 1 at a time though as it get a boring in the higher levels trying to earn money and not having anything to do. If I could work on more than one the rating would be a 4. 5 stars would be if we could pick colours etc and make it more customizable,3,1,1.8.4
A Google user,I love this game. Yes you have to pay or watch an ad to get the better benefits but the makers of the game need to make money somehow. I think the player interface works great and the upgrade system is nice too. I only wish there were more hotels to play.,5,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Spelling mistakes all over, and unless you pay, or watch loads of ads, it is really slow to progress. Review update. 5 stars on first hotel, and only 4 on second and third. Need 15 to progress, but I've bought everything and can't work out how to improve further",1,1,1.3.0
A Google user,Easy controls. And rather addictive. However Is there a way to spend the money from one hotel to another? Just seems kind of pointless to continue collecting a ton of money from my first hotel if everything is upgraded and i cant spend it on anything else. Edit: i already have my first 3 hotels maxed on everything. Is there going to be more hotels added. Other than the issue with the money just piling it is a very fun game.,2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Excellent game, very addictive, but probably the first game ever where I recommend NOT to pay to get rid of the adverts/double pay/hotel management while youre not playing. If you do, you finish the game far too quickly. Took me a week and now theres nothing left to do.",5,1,1.2.1
A Google user,"Really fun game. Love that you don't need to do in in-app purchases to complete the game. But there's a bug at the third hotel. Every time I exit the game, even though I have a full occupancy, minutes after, I open the game and they will be gone and reduced to only 2. Please fix this.",3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Love the game, love the graphics, love putting time in for it. I didn't rate five for the fact I feel so pressured to purchase in-game microtransactions in order to achieve upgrades I should be able to buy with in-game currency. Other than that, great game!",4,1,1.2.1

A Google user,"I'm actually enjoying this game. The ads can be a little much at times, but you need to make funds somehow. Please add more hotels!!! Just a few suggestions for improved game play: * can the guests wake up at different times * can there be a cafe option open when the restaurant is not * room service, where a guest pays more to eat on the balcony * more hotels * be able to adjust service times - a bar closing at 7pm is crazy",5,1,1.2.1

A Google user,"Great game at first, very addictive, but once you run out of energy, thats it, you dont earn enough money from the rooms to be able to buy more so you are constantly watching ads which are still not enough and you have to watch several.

A Google user,I fell in love with this game! I have to give it 3 stars because it KEEPS STOPPING. It just freezes before watching a video when investors come in and I have to exit and restart the app. Please fix it if you can. Awesome game! UPDATE: Hasn't happened since.,5,1,1.4.2
A Google user,Can be a great game but the mixture of 30 second that play back to back to back is very annoying. If you finish a hotel you can't take the profits over to the next.. And it can be addictive.. But if you want to watch Rage ads And Grasshopper ads over and over to improve your hotel by all means play this.. Lmao,1,1,
A Google user,Love the concept of the game and the detail is great however there are many glitches. - Half the time the ad's for the investor won't play and you have to shut the whole app down which looses some of your progress. - if you aren't active on the game and click back on half of your rooms are empty yet when you are active they all get filled and are turning potential customers away. This is with everything maxed out ... - when you double income from whilst not playing any other disappears.,3,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Pretty fun. It's different in how you have to continue to pay the workers unlike in other games from the developer and you do have to balance income from expenses but it doesn't take away from the game at all. There are some small bugs here and there but nothing game breaking. I also like how when you're ready to move to the next stage, you keep managing the previous hotels.",5,1,1.2.0
LauraLou888,Well love the game but atm you can only watch 1 ad at a time without closing game and reopening so this is ruining the game for me as I won't be able to complete the event without them. I have uninstalled the game b4 to fix but if I do that now I'll lose my event progress. So please fix the ads!!!!!!,2,1,1.9.7
A Google user,"Pretty enjoyable love the concept. Just want to add an idea, if you could, some how incorporate the transfer of money between hotels maybe a premium add on/update then I feel there would be better use for the idle money that is sitting around. I cannot upgrade or anything with the first hotel so money is just sitting. Or another idea would be an expansion with the first hotel to luxury, for a better replay value when traveling between hotels. Please continue the update!",4,1,1.2.0

A Google user,This game was ok until it started glitching. One of my stars never came even though I completed the missions. I messaged support 3 times for 3 days and they haven't responded to me at ALL. I'm glad I withheld myself from spending money on it until I played a little longer or I would have lost my money on the game too. You don't even get your rewards all the time for watching the stupid videos. Not worth the download when they clearly don't offer support.,1,1,

Looking forward to a new hotel theme :) keep up the good work guys",5,1,1.3.1
Saliha Rahat,This is an exciting App ..oh yeah I enjoyed it.. It's kinda fun and surprising like you're buying some decor things that's surely awesome and gives a surprising look to the hotel. so yes lemme come to point which i found a problem .. if we are going to the next place you have to start with the very first means you don't have much money to buy something ...Is this possible like we would be having our some money from the previous hotel. ?

M&M,It's a great game to be honest. I gave it 5 stars before but now I give it 4 stars. At first it was great then I saw the prices but I was making money fast so it was no problem but when I got my second hotel the prices to me where ridiculous and it's not like u can use the profit from one hotel in another hotel,4,1,1.7.2
Justin Pimental,Edit on the first day!! I have all of the housekeepers and they just stop working and stand in a room or go to their lounge and sit. This is frustrating. Just started the game and it seems fun. I like having the option to pay once to remove ads but still get the benefits,2,1,1.8.2

Dillon Walker,Although there are very many advertisements. You do get the option to pay to get rid of them. Overall very well made game and very fun.

They could atleast let you withdraw a percentage each day. Fix this !!",3,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Its a ok game but really slow moving and gets boring fast. And so slow at making money. To buy upgrades with real money is quite high for what lil u get from them.

yukipedia,"I recommend giving this idlw one a try because unlike most idle games this one is actually f2p friendly and you don't need to even spam ads to get huge profits, it's satisfying to hear the music nad see the customers using services in your hotel.

The first time I played there were like only 4 hotels but now there is almost double that amount and they also add events everytime one is finished. Give it a chance at least try it.",5,1,2.3.1

I should have dropped a review way back when i started playing it Ive had it for years on my phone and multiple phones lemme say..as this is such a stress buster and has super funny graphics and attention to detail should not go unappreciated. So Kudos to the team.GOOD JOB on the game. Ive played almost all of your developed games and byfar this is my fav.,5,1,
Leanne VZ,"Enjoyable and challenging game. But once you have finished all the hotels you can't reset them w/out new acc . It's worth paying extra to have ads removed and night time to finish quicker. Makes the game more enjoyable. I am sorry to say (might be in the minority) I prefer the competitions as they were before, dancing king was giving away only one $100,000's. Where is the strategy, challenge and persistence to reach just the $15,000,000 mark to earn 5%. When is competition for last 3 managers?",3,1,2.0
Sarah,"It's fun at first, but they need to add the ability to purchase other amneties in the hotels that have already been completed. It's a waste of time otherwise, they gain all this money and you can't do anything with it. It becomes monotenous and stops being enjoyable unfortunately",3,1,2.3.3
Thanh N.,Pacing is too slow. The money gained is so low that it forces you to watch many ads to gain money to use to have any kind of fun in the game. It got to the point that I was watching ads longer than playing the game. No thanks. Didn't encounter any bugs. Game works great.,2,1,
sanjana tabassum,At first this game was fun to play but if u reach 5__ in a hotel u can't upgrade it anymore also u can't use the money from 5__ hotel to ur second hotels. So no use for making a hotel 5__ also it's very hard to make a hotel 5__ cause at first ur income will be in negative and u have to watch ads to earn more money. It's a little bit boring also kills lots of time. It will be fun to play if I could use money from one hotel to another,3,1,1.8.4
A Google user,"Starting each hotel is unfair because you generally don't make a profit. Some hotels like the events are designed so your cleaning crew takes paths so long they can't clean in time. Worst of all, watching ads for money fails sometimes and I don't recieve the money I should. Another game designed to sap players of their real money.",1,1,1.4.2
A Google user,"Very hard to get started, without the momey boosts from watching ads BUT you don't actually get the rewards from watching ads cause the game automatically redirects you to the play store and has to reload, when you switch back to it! So infuriating!",1,1,1.3.0
A Google user,It takes ages to be able to buy something. Everything is so expensive. It took me quite a few weeks to even get a double room. And there is loads of things to track like electricity. Would put 0 stars if I could. __ Wish I could enjoy it,1,1,0.3.0
Ahsri Limas,This game is good but the tech support is not good at solving the problem.. i did many time give them a feedback but NO RESPOND AT ALL. I encounter alot of not responding and error. And sometime the game kick out it self. I am very disappointed to the tech support.,1,1,1.7.1
stacey3107,"Good game, but I think we should be able to keep the money from other fully upgraded hotels to use on one that hasn't been fully upgraded. Instead of leaving the money earned in each individual hotel. Maybe also add achievements to earn gems.",5,1,1.8.4
A Google user,"Honestly could have been fun, but the some of the ads force you out of the app and into the app store to download whatever ad you were just watching. It got very annoying because it was pretty much every other ad.",2,1,1.2.1
A Google user,"There's a bug now I've noticed after the event hotel disappeared/finished where when I open the app again (after closing the process), it doesn't bring me back to the last hotel I was working on and always brings me to the first hotel in the list. It's very annoying",4,1,1.4.0
A Google user,"Love the game but i have ran out of things to do, i have all the upgrades, could be a good idea if there were different floors with more rooms and different types of entertainment like arcades etc. Also more levels would be good too",5,1,0.1.1
A Google user,This idle game to me covered all aspects and has been my favorite. Along with all the funny things to watch theirs plenty to do and enough upgrades in this one.and plenty ways to build up your money.. Even though their is in game purchases this game gives you plenty of opportunity's to make cash! I never felt the need to have to buy anything. Good job! I'm looking for more games from them and hope they stay away from pay to play games.These are the games that we should support though if able.,4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,I like the game but it's not perfect. Despite using all my gems for upgrades and using cash to pay for the needed hotel upgrades there seems to be no way for me to get even one 5 star hotel to move to the next level. I don't mind all the ads and I'm not sure why we can use money saved in n another hotel.,2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"I do like playing this game but keeps showing that there is not enough energy to build a certain part, even when I've just opened the game and not upgraded or built anything. Very frustrating, going nowhere fast with this game, thinking about u installing it actually __",2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"This is a fun game where you can save money and be forced to build a bar before you can reach your money goal!!! I like the game, don't get me wrong. But I hate the way it forces you to bye stuff when you were planning on saving up to bye everything at once! Why did you make this feature and why do you want to force people to bye stuff when they've only got so much money.",2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,Just started and unlocked the bar area but it's nice and relaxing and i can play it at work. And if not i can close it and reopen it later and make double the money watching an ad real quick. It's great.,5,1,1.4.0
A Google user,Game is superb.. but without ad watching you can't upgrade the things in your room. Because each upgrade cost is high. Earning is very low. Without watching upgrading the things will take 1 year to complete the 1st hotel challenge. I'm uninstalling,3,1,1.5.0
Ajay Sharma,Ths game is awesome.... But if we can upgrade multiple items in a room at single click it will be way better.... Also if we have enough we must beable to buy a fully furnished room for somelower cost... Some more amenities like kids activities etc canbe added which will make the game more fun,4,1,1.8.4
Hajima Mai,"Even if it's fun but I found 2 annoying bug of this game. Firstly, I often waste time watching ads in order to receiving some money in game. Secondly, I sometimes stuck during playing and I couldn't even move anything.",2,1,1.8
Aaron Palmer,"Great game, a few glitches with bonus cash and the extra customers game keeps getting stuck with them on. Have to restart the game each time also the game looses customer on me. I have a full hotel and then restart the game due to above glitches and then I have only half the customers.",3,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"Fun game but it is obvious this is just a money maker. I have maxed out the first two resorts but need 9 stars to get to the next, of course. Sorry, but I am not spending any money on this and from reading other comments it is probably just as well. Obviously I still would not be able to get to the last resort anyway. Too many ads as well. Deleting now!",1,1,
A Google user,Abit slow to start with but not a bad game to kill some time on. Its ashame that when your not playing you make upto 2hours of profit anything after that you get nothing. I suppose it's a way to make you keep coming back. You have to depend on adverts to watch to get some decent start up money from investors. Apart from these afew things for only playing a day. I cant a better review would need at least a week for better feedback,4,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"So i have been playing for 2 weeks now and i have moved on to the ""stanley resort"". The advertisements honestly helped progress. i wish i could do more with the first hotel that i already made into a 5 STAR hotel just so i have a reason to switch from one to another. Its collecting money but i cant do anything else with the money. If i complete the whole game i am out of it and wont further support it if the road ends. Thank you",3,1,1.2.0
Helen M,"Ok so looks like some effort into fixing the game to stop it crashing all the time, BUT , it still crashes!!! When trying to watch an ad it crashes, Not quite as much, it sucks cos its a decent game.",1,1,1.7.1
RL Graham,"This game is good, I really like it...but the issue is that the playable ads ruin the ablility to view other ads in order to do business with the gold dude. Can you please do something about that, because it's ruining the experience.",2,1,1.7.1
Judit Buskohl,This is a fun game and the upgrades you get for the hotel help a lot. The thing that doesn't help a lot is all of the crashes and when I watch a video it also crashes.,2,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"Overall an entertaining game. One thing I would change would be the ad to skip the night. I'm happy to let an ad run to get coins, but the ad to get past a hotel of people sleeping is annoying.",3,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"The lower hotels become pointless as you move up. It'd be great if they could integrate them as you move up. Also, sometimes the ads are LONG and then you get left without the reward you waited for.",3,1,1.3.0
A Google user,"Both my hotels should be 5 stars. That's NOT the case. So they give an update only that opened up 2 new hotels, one in which is a holiday christmas theme. Well see here's the thing you cannot open the 3rd hotel because it REQUIRES 9 stars. Well how the hell is that possible when I only have 4 stars a piece for hotel 1 and 2. Get it together DEVS. Automatic DELETE. what a waste of the time and days I've spent on this useless game. Had promise and even got the bonus UPGRADES, still Nothing. TRASH",1,1,1.2.0
Alisha Biermann,I love to play this game to pass time. I bought the ad dog a d personally it was worth it cause the game goes by a lot faster. But you can play perfectly fine without it. You only get ads when you are doing something to earn money or what not. :D I do recommend this game.,5,1,1.8.2
david vorpe,"I have read all the negative comments and issues some ppl have, I downloaded this game and I can't put it down, I look forward to coming home just to play it. Sometimes you have to spend a little money to have a enjoyable game, I spent the money to get rid of the ads. I find it easy to make money to improve your hotel. So what if the guests wonder around aimlessly, you still make money. Great game that provides hours of entertainment",5,1,2.3.1
A Google user,I love the game and there was literally one thing that I disliked! It was the amount of money that you had to pay for certain items such as the bar (6000). Well done for everything else though as it is a great game and clearly had a lot of work put into it. The idea was absolutely fantastic and you ver much pulled it off! I love it!,4,1,1.2.1
A Google user,"Very good game about managing your money, but it sucks when you watch an ad to get money when you really need it and the screen just goes black and you don't get anything -_-. Overall, a very good game __",5,1,1.2.0
A Google user,My personal experience was not great it's really slow and I bought everything and was still boring it's NOT FUN you just stress out cuz is not an ability game it's really good looking game and funny to see the people with different costumes but not worth it but I can see some people liking it just not me or any young person my age my friends tried it out and they'd pass so that's that,2,1,
A Google user,Boring. I've done the 4 hotels. Maxed out the stars on them. Now nothing else to do. Give us more hotels to build. Also it's impossible to properly finish it all without paying for gems. Ive tried to contact the developers but the email address isn't active.,1,1,1.2.1
Yotrisno Lang,"Upgrading hotel only possible through watching ads. On 2nd hotel, the operational cost is way too high compared to the income, and the money from other hotels are not transferable. It doesn't make sense at all",1,1,1.8.2
Camiilleij,I love this game! The graphics and gameplay is nice and easy. There are other hotels u can manage and u get money off them too. I wish theres an option where you yourself can choose which room the guests go.,4,1,1.8.4
heaven,"Unlike other Codigames apps, this one game is way too slow. The rewards from the ads are very little, so it's frustrating. I know it's idle app but making money shouldn't way too slow. At least offer good rewards with ads.",1,1,1.8.1
A Google user,"Fun little game to pass time. Ads to achieve goals faster gets quite repetitive but certainly help. It's easy enough, gradually gets more challenging and free to play. Overall pretty good.",4,1,1.3.1
A Google user,The game is pretty fun and if you pay the little bit of money to double your profits and turn off advertisements it makes it even more fun great Pastime fun to watch the little characters run around I'd say it'll be better when they add more stuff but right now it's fantastic,4,1,1.3.1
A Google user,"Reply to Codigames: Yes the money from the ads are great however my issue with the game is that there is no way to see why the characters are upset so, I am just watching ads in order to make money that should not be necessary. This is an ad generated game. There is no real way to advance without watching ads for additional money. The guests are upset and leave, but you don't know why, so that it can be fixed. So you have to watch ANOTHER ad to quickly get more guests. Lame!",2,1,1.1.0
Julio Cesar,The game is great but I think I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game in 3 days like 30 times because ads stop appearing due to some kind of bug. At this point I find it funny that they suggest the No Ad purchase.,2,1,2.5.1
A Google user,"good game, i enjoy those type of games. Tho only 4 stars because the game has often lag spikes making characters glitch. It also could use more randomness for when people go in and get out of the hotel. Would make it more interesting.",4,1,1.1.0
A Google user,"So much fun! Very addictive. I wish there was a help icon. I have a few questions. *Edit* I'm going to go from 5 stars down to 4. On your next update please add a ""max upgrade"" button. It's very annoying to have to push the upgrade button dozens of times to upgrade every item in a room individually. It would be great if, for example, you had ""Sofa Upgrade $1,200"" or ""Sofa Max Upgrade $15,000"" as well as ""Room Max Upgrade 525,000"" or whatever the prices may be.",4,1,1.6.0
A Google user,"Would be better if I could get the videos for extra cash to play. About 80% of the time I hit Play Video and it just goes back to the hotel with no extra cash! Fix the problem and I'll rate you higher. And yes, I did send an email to support.....but no reply yet. Still no reply. Uninstalling. Looks like I'm not the only one having this issue - with no reply or comments from the developers. SAD!!!",1,1,1.2.0
Dieter Harper,"Have played the game on and off for sometime now, starting to see issues with collecting large amounts of money past the 1m mark. It prompts to say when you have been offline that you have earned X amount but it doesn't go in to the usable funds pot. Needs fixing",3,1,2.0
A Google user,"When I first downloaded this game I had no idea what it would be like but after 3 days or so I had already had mostly everything upgraded. And then I unlocked the second hotel and it was so hard to start earning heaps of money again. I have 6 single rooms and 3 double rooms everytime I leave the app the people in the double rooms at the time glitch out so I'm losing that extra money. They should let us use all the money we earn accessible for all hotels because my first hotel has $200,000+",2,1,1.2.0
Wilbur Hough,"""Hello, I knew this moment was coming!! I love this game, yes, seriously!! __ My name is Wilbur, and playing this game, is a lot of fun__, and at the same time, I am learning a lot while playing. __ The game is superbly well designed, and runs smoothly__ on my Samsung Galaxy A12.

A Google user,"So today I finally made it to the last hotel which I had been hyped for because the crystal paradise resort was challenging and beautiful. But now that I get to Santa's shelter its supposed to be the next level up. But I feel like I've gone down to the standards of my very first hotel. Also I hate that money doesn't transfer over from previous hotels, I mean theres not really a reason to keep the money there if you can't buy anything else.",3,1,1.2.1
james koelling,"Id rate it 5 stars but I honestly can't. I paid for upgrades in the game long ago when it was being updated but thes no longer any updates, all there is, is events. Something that's not gonna do anything for me. Now that its been a while I'm not eligible for a refund but I'd be willing to do whats needed for it. Why do I need to skip ads if it's only going to further me in events that can't even further me in the normal game? Not worth putting any money into unless there's an actual good update",2,1,2.1
Vanlalruata Ralte,"Fun idle game, it isn't too difficult to progress. The grind is there but ads can also provide some quick cash, and you can keep progressing and upgrade with different hotels. Very good game, very good experience",5,1,2.4
Leslie Bunting,"The game is okay overall. It's almost impossible to get the amount of money you need to build things without the watching ads. Don't waste your time watching the adds thinking you'll get double your earnings, because you won't.",4,1,2.6.1
Purva Malkar,Please update the app for the ads issue. No more ads are available to me. After contacting to the support team they say it will be solved as soon as possible and there are no good results yet. Without the ads and double rewards it becomes completely hopeless to play the game and earn more stars. I request the CODIGAMES to take this on priority basis.,1,1,
A Google user,"What hotel have you stayed at in 2019-2020 is 12 for a room. It's hard to run the hotel because you are given nothing to start with, rooms are cheap for guest but expensive for you to purchase, the wages of the employees is ok, but not really due to the fact you are not making anything. Hotels do not operate unless they have capital to do so. There needs to be adjustments. Upgrading rooms is ridiculous. Worst rifle game every. It keeps crashing as well.",3,1,1.3.0
Al1145 XD,"I enjoyed this game 4 starts due to it's easy when you get the hang of the game before I bought the ""no ads"" they can be annoying but there was no massive pop up but they wasn't long ads and they wouldn't crash my phone so that was a plus,",4,1,2.2.1
A Google user,It was a cool game and I would give 5 stars however__ if you miss a day they close your hotel and you start from nothing__I was on Hotel #3!!!! Which is not cool and not to mention if you save up you diamonds to get extras in the rooms if your hotel starts over you have to earn the diamonds again to pay for the same things you paid for before__. The game says Idle but it's a lie. There is nothing idle about it I will not be playing this game anymore if this continues.,1,1,1.1.1
Brandon Sawler,If you're going to host an event for all players where you can gain benefit to special items... At least make it available to free to play players. Because I've done the math there is absolutely no way for a free to play player to hit the minimum threshold for even the lowest tier. It'll cost you a minimum of $50 CAD which is pathetic. I'm going to play the game because it's fun. But y'all are a bunch of money grubbing hacks. Pathetic,1,1,2.6.1
Evan Steward,It is a very fun game with lots of things to do. I think it deserves 4 stars because it has everything to be a good game but there is something missing. I think the need to add a daily rewards (money) so then it is easier for beginners to upgrade things.,4,1,2.4
A Google user,"I want to like this game. seems fun and extensive. However, the ROI on ad watching mixed with a fair bit of reliance is almost unbearable. 45 seconds for 200 cash? I can barely upgrade anything worthwhile for that. And the important person comes all the time. Even instant sunrise takes 40 seconds. And no, $11 for ad removal is not soemthing I am gonna do. You gain hourly but you have to pay daily wages and when game closed your residents don't dont move, like to get food, which gets most cash",3,1,1.7.1
Jesse Iford,The game was (is) enjoyable but there were a lot of bonuses behind ads and they got annoying pretty quickly. I thought it was worth it to pay to have the ads removed and it really is.,4,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Really enjoying the game. Only downside is you need to earn cash from completing tasks and not diamond as takes too long building up. EDITED - was interesting for about 2 days. Only get a few tasks per hotel then it's just a case of waiting round for cash to build with nothing to do in the meantime. Deleting now,1,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"In order to get anywhere in the game (without paying upwards of 10 dollars) you have to wait ridiculously long. I like the game, I just don't like watching an hour worth of ads to buy whatever I need for a mission in the game.",2,1,1.4.2

A Google user,"New to the game and I have been enjoying it. However, the one thing I don't like is that after you finish all of the missions for the hotel there is nothing to spend the money on and the game doesn't allow you to spend the money on the next hotel. What is the point of upgrading to 5 stars to make more money if you can't use the money for anything? Seems a bit pointless. You should be able to use the money towards upgrading the next hotel.",3,1,1.3.1
A Google user,This game is fantastic. I like it but I think that there is one problem because when we go to new restaurant we have not enough money to upgrade it .So please add this feature that the money we have earned from previous restaurant can be used in next restaurant. Thanks,5,1,1.6.0
Aryan Jaff,When you will add new levels am almost finishing the Arabian night resort and cool and challenging. As an advice I hope you upgrade or expand the game a little more that you can move more away from the hotel and upgrade the streets the surrounding area new cars new them songs according to the levels and more animation more HD resolution when zooming etc.,5,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Good game but very short. Theres only four Hotels you can build. Very hard to make money when some of your businesses close early. There needs to be more levels and you should be able to control the check out time and when your businesses close,3,1,1.2.1
Jessica Dettmann,"Its a fun game, but ive been having issues where it won't progress when I leave the app. Kinda crucial for an idle game. Tried emailing the dev with my concerns only to get an email saying it was undeliverable. Pretty frustrated right now.",3,1,1.7.2
Jaiden White,I love this game and all it's features. I can't find any reason why I'd wanna uninstall or restart except for I want there to be more hotels. Like idea you can have a tech area.

Deborah Stover,I have enjoyed this game for years...first on my iPad and now on my phone..I've recently deleted this game from my iPad because the only thing to play is the codi hotel which is repetitive and boring I really wish the game makers would do a major update of all existing hotels as in adding more rooms venues etc to make the game challenging again ...I'm almost done with the hotels on my phone and if there's no new major updates or hotels I will be deleting it also..make this game awesome again!!!!,3,1,2.1

I downloaded this and played it for two hours straight, the only problem I had was once I had multiple rooms the game crashed when I was scrolling through the rooms.

I did buy all the extra employees which I wouldn't normally do but this game is great and still challenging",5,1,1.3.1
A Google user,my opinion is you guys have to make that the hotel will run even if we quit the game. this is because not everyone have their leasure time to play this game and some of the people need to quit this game for sleep or working or studying. this simple feature alone can attract many people to play this great game in the future. keep it up the good work!,4,1,1.2.0

A Google user,I dont like how you have to continually have to watch ads to get enough money to even but 1 thing but its optional you don't make a lot of progress if you dont but the reason why I rated it for 5 was because it's such a good game it also teaches you how to save your money when you grow up and work in a hotel if you end up working in 1 but overall it's such a good game and I think you should download it,5,1,1.5.0
A Google user,It was the best game I've ever played in 7 years the Tycoon idle games are really fun to play but this one is a game-changer because it is a hotel styled game with many hotels and different layouts of the map I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed the game.,5,1,1.1.1

A Google user,Really fun game once you have played for a while. Lets you have a good idea of how business works. It's a challenging game that takes a lot of time though but it isn't just a really easy idle game that you'll play once,4,1,1.3.1

Ieva Ananka,Constantly throws me out of the game after a few seconds. Please fix the bugs.,1,1,2.8
Devan Hoffer,It's good but limiting. I think they need to make it so you can prestige hotels and start over. I would like to keep playing but I've finished all the hotels and the event ones aren't enough for me to keep playing,4,1,1.9.93
A Google user,"The games actually pretty fun with a realisitic balance of income and expenses, This makes it slower than some other fames, but i actually enjoy that. Small visiblenupgrades here and there and a nice progression. Im enjoying it so far.",5,1,1.5.0
James Millward,This game is epic. It gives you a real life experience of running a hotel. Also you have to pay your staff like real life only on your device. But the only problem is the power. I don't want to buy loads of batteries for my hotel energy its a waste of money __ but still a very good game so I recommend downloading it,4,1,2.2.1
A Google user,"The game is okay, but in the first hotel level. After I completed the mission on the first hotel, the money that I saved can'tbe used to the other hotels. That was so hard and I think you need to update yhis game so that I/we can used the money or let say put some withdrawal machine so that we can withdraw or loan option to the other hotels i think the game mission will be easier, little bit easier. Then please rem9ve the real money to hire manager",4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,I just started playing and maxed out everything in the first hotel. I like the game but a few changes can be made like example customers can not only reload on gems but reload on bills. Also another thing is the customer money should be also stay with them no matter what hotel they play not having to start over getting money all over again so like if you have left over money and ur maxed out of one hotel you can use the left over money on the next hotel.,2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,This is a very good game once you level up your hotel you get so much money and my customers love my hotel. At first I thought I could never pay for all the upgrades but then the money came piling in and I could buy everything! I highly recommend this game you should all download it.,5,1,1.2.0

J H,Love the idea and practical experience of this game!!! The only issue is that there shoukd be more updates instead of so many automated seasonal events Just keep adding more hotels!!!!!! And this will change to a 5*,2,1,2.7
Tiff Tiph,"I'm on Santa's Resort {the 4th one}& everytime I leave the game & come back, it resets everything as tho I didn't upgrade them, like the spa where I paid the 555,000 to upgrade the tub to lvl 4 {or 98%}, would go back to lvl 3. As well as the sauna that I purchased TWICE for 80 diamonds each time, just to come back & find my sauna GONE.. AS WELL as the diamonds!.. And the electrical room would be at 100% & when I come back, it would be back to 94%.. It isn't right to just take it all away __",1,1,1.7.4
A Google user,BRING back the single hotel events and not this new one with managers. I didn't think I have to start over each time the game comes back. I had several rooms and had brought all activities. I thought the hotel from previous game would come back where you left off with the money you accomplished.,1,1,1.4.2
A Google user,"I love this game, its a great time killer. But now i have upgraded everything in my 3rd hotel and i still don't get the 5th star to move on. I am hoping this is a game glitch but now that i can't move on or upgrade anything in any of my hotels i feel this game is useless. I even paid for the valentine's special for no adds and permanent x2 profits. I feel a little ripped off now.",3,1,1.3.1

zoe wisor,When I clicked on the install button I was hoping that this game would be amazing and I got what I wanted. Because of how you can build rooms and all sorts of stuff and if their was an update any time soon. I hope they will make it better and so much cooler. And people who don't have this game I think you should because THIS GAME IS AMAZING! (And it's funny how their faces turn red when their using the bathroom) just get the game,5,1,1.8.4
Infinity phantom Studios,"Game is superb and the thing is to introduce money converter. For eg, The currency in the first hotel should have less value than second hotel (1=25).And second hotel have less value than third hotel. This is because when we upgrade 1st hotel into 5 star rated hotel , there is no upgrade in that hotel just collecting money. What to do with that money ? So please update this feature and I will rate 5 star.",4,1,1.7.1
Diyana Mohd,The game was good but there is no other way to get gems rather than complete the mission and buy it from the developer. And suppostly the money that u get from another hotel can be carried to another hotel. Or maybe half of it. (just for the first opening) because it is hard to make new hotel with a small budjet,3,1,1.7.1
A Google user,"Although I'm really enjoying the game, I'm pretty disappointed that you can't use the money you make at your previous hotels to upgrade the one you're currently working on.

TP Channel,"The game is fun until you reached higher level due to item upgrading speed is slow.

A Google user,"Its a fun game overall. You dont need to pay real money to achieve in this game, but I was tempted and have paid to remove all ads, only later found out the game only has 5 stages.

Pixel Meg,GAME BREAKING GLITCH when playing be aware that apparently sometimes it straight WILL NOT give you you idle time money. Remember to click off event hotels before you exit out of your app. I was on track to at least get 2 different 2 star managers but because of this glitch I got one of them missed the other and may not get the 3rd.,3,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Played for about a week and the videos i watch to earn more cash dont work.. None of the X2 when log in or when the VIP comes with cash for watching videos. Reviews previous also said the same. Please fix the problem. It wont cause players to spend money only to be angry and not enjoy the game. Other then that if additional hotels and overall overall maintenance would improve I believe the game could make a lot of money and keep a lot of people busy,1,1,1.2.0
Debbie Fenton,Love the game very addictive. Have now finished Camelot the last hotel. Is there more coming or is that the end.,5,1,2.9
Christina Bickel,Not enough ad double times bonus. You literally have to watch almost 7 minutes of ads to get two hours worth of double pay. Not worth it. And to get rid of the ads you have to pay $11! Ridiculous,2,1,1.8.1
Kiyoshi Life (Shing),"So far it's an ok game, it takes a while to get the upgrades and get farther in it. It's not good enough to give it any more stars than this and it's way too similar to the other idle games to make it a standalone masterpiece. I just got to the second hotel and we'll see if it gets better.",3,1,2.4

It wont let me watch videos, and every time I exit the game it makes some of my people disappear and suddenly half my rooms are empty. It was fun until this started happening.

Brian Misko,"The game was great but now its just ok, ever since i got to Santa Hotel part..when santa guy would appear to get ur bonus he would just walk away after hitting button without video or ur bonus most of the time, which i think is total BS, yes still same guests running to everyone around and into each other, so i might be fading away from game for now until its fixed, hate to see what the next level/hotel does...bye for now",2,1,2.1
Brittany Benge,"I loved this game up until the Christmas hotel. That one is boring and hideous, also a lot of people don't celebrate Christmas.

Divinus Oculus (Danielle),Its an ok game.. Takes a long time to start it off because beginning costs of obtaining and upgrading rooms and items in rooms are expensive and you don't make much money. There is no explanation as to what the icons that appear over the guests heads mean.. I keep getting one that is red with a fork and knife.. Which upon googling is supposed to mean they're upset they don't have a seat available in the restaurant but i can only have 6 guests at a time and i have 3 tables so it's not that.,3,1,1.7.1

A Google user,"5, 10, and 15 bucks is really expensive for managers. Very slow to progress, even watching the vip videos every time. Also, please take off that housekeeping is losing profit.

And a suggestion.. maybe there can be a personalized hotel that we can build as we like..,5,1,1.4.2

And have buy VIP that cost $15! This sucks! Besides, you have resources to make an update and create a one time event hotel but not extending hotel?!",1,1,1.4.2
Brenda Lee,Bigger not always better. The concept is great. When you get to the last couple of hotels its way to big. People spend to much time walking to the different places. Bed time goes through 7am. Check out is at 6 by the time they get back to the room. Lets get back to the smaller hotels please or make instant check out and ect.....,4,1,1.7.3
A Google user,It's a very good game you do NOT have to pay to play to fully enjoy. Now at this time it's still a new game but feel like there could be more options in upgrading and maybe some sort of training for the staff other then that I love it and will keep playing,4,1,1.0
A Google user,"The game is somewhat ad-heavy to make quick progress, but I'm happy they are voluntary. It's definitely one of the better options in the idle/tycoon niche.",4,1,1.1.1
Sneha77,"I got a glitch or bug, sometimes when the dancing king come then he goes without even asking for giving money. What is this means why do he come if he not want to give money,I am fed up of him! And keeping it side this game is very nice we can play this game at work or any multitasking ,I like it, it's the best game and if you fix it then I will give you 5star And also,Best Game Ever!",4,1,2.0
Forcule,"Overall a good game, perfect if you wanna relax while playing. Easy to understand and it has alot of stuff to explore. Highly recommend.",5,1,2.7
Travon,This game is awesome. Very detailed and I feel like I have total control Edit: it would be alot better if we had a upgrade all or upgrade max button instead of having to tap each and every upgrade level,5,1,1.8.4
Janine Simon,"Game glitches out. Sometimes you don't receive your reward for watching the ads. It also glitched out when I reached arabian nights. The developers emailed me back saying they will contact the ad people. Its your game, not the ads. I also didn't receive my gems after upgrading the battery for the electrical room.",1,1,1.7.1
Razia Wadhwa,Very dumb game. Also some people are standing and sleeping the whole night.Thats creepy. There is nothing to do in the game. There are just lots of ads to earn money. Also u cant spend money earned from one hotel to another. Then whats the point of getting earnings from that hotel that has got 5 stars. Also no sense of playing for those hotels who has already earned 5 stars.,2,1,1.8.3
Neca,I keep watching videos and not receiving my rewards. It didn't start doing this until I built my second hotel now everytime I watch a video I'm not getting the rewards. When I click the 2x video I watch the video and no money at all.,1,1,1.8.1
Heinrich Joemath,Curiosity as to the next hotels offering is all that got me through this game. Mundane in terms of goals. Logging in every couple of hours just to cash in to pay for item upgrades. Game has no reward or competitive nature.,2,1,
coleslaw,so far its been delightful. very sweet and the little characters are actually unexpectedly adorable. also jazzy music which is an instant bonus. id say its really entertaining little tycoon. adverts are pretty much optional so it's really nice ^_^ x,5,1,2.4
A Google user,"I don't mind the videos to get extra stuff, but it's annoying when you get the option to watch the video and it never starts, then losing the opportunity to get the extra stuff.",2,1,1.3.0
Myka Ruest,The game is good but I have to deduct for so many ads and the ad removal costing 10$ instead of 99¡é. I think it's annoying watching instead of playing this game.,1,1,1.8.4
Becky Newton,"I download this give 3 days ago, I find it very addictive the only problem is the amount of videos you have to watch to get money. Also I cant move forward on the my third hotel as both hotel have 4* I have maxed everything out an yet it still wo t let me move to the next hotel as you need 9* to open it. Really disappointing not gonna lie does anyone know how I can make the 5* so I can move on if not the game is getting uninstalled!",2,1,1.7.1
Samik De,Need upgrade as per graphics and make more attractive.. Where are the discotheque and more and more things.. Lots of things like fire accident and all types of problem solving games.. Sexual orientation things must be there in the game.. Make more attractive..,3,1,1.9.9
A Google user,"I'll give it this, it is a fun game to play and start it does require money if you wanna get somewhere fast but that's fine if you are patient the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is they could do so much more with this game that they just haven't yet one big thing being after I max out a hotel like the first one there is no reason to ever go back and check on it.. you can't do anything on it anymore and the money you collect on it at that point just piles up cause you can't spend it on anything",3,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"Love the whole concept of the game but 1 thing is missing . It would be great if we can have the option to redecorate the hotel such as the wallpaper , the floor etc .",3,1,1.6.0
A Google user,Good game with some decent game play options but quite a few bugs in terms of people getting stuck in places and things that should be done on time not getting done which is slightly annoying.,4,1,1.1.1
A Google user,Its fun but since i moved to hotel #2 everytime i back out of the game and then come back in my customers are gone. Even if i back out for a second and come back they are gone. And when i watch ads sometimes i dont get the reward it said. Its fun just needs some bugs fixed.,3,1,1.6.0
Matthew Hall,I lovw this game irs amazing. The only reason I have given it 4 stars is because I tried to get my first hotel up to 5 stars and I couldn't. I upgraded the power generators to max and there still isn't enough power to upgrade everything. If tou could please fix this bug I will rate this 5 stars.,4,1,1.7.3
A Google user,"Used to be great but now, for some reason, the videos dont play so i cant get the bonuses. Additionally, the game is buggy as hell as and logging out and back in results in lost guests and money. Tried to get help and it just links through to Paypal !!!!!",1,1,1.5.0
A Google user,Just lost all my employees but 2 after building the bar and being gone 5 minutes from the game. I don't have the time to stay and babysit it nor do I have the $10.99 this quick into the game to hire the person to collect for me. Uninstalling.,1,1,1.4.0
James Horner,Buggy program. There is a bug in the program that you do not get your earnings from a hotel when you go back into the game. I have missed out on several million dollars worth of earnings because of this bug. I like the updates and the fact that they keep expanding it but it's disappointing that we lose out.,2,1,1.8.3
Mark Pikett,Used to be enjoyable but had no new levels in a while and is very glitchy and unstable,1,1,2.8
Maurizio Tamburlini,Even after buying they keep wanting more money to keep it playable,1,1,2.8
A Google user,It's an Ad Trap! The cost of building a room is 6000 which will only gonna give you 30/hr in return and you also gonna need very much power to run the hotel as it will not gonna have any electricity like normal hotels and you have to generate your own power. So you have to depend very much of your revenue on watching 30 second ads and mind you you gonna always be struck in this endless cycle forever until you decide to uninstall the game.,1,1,1.5.0
A Google user,"Would give it 5 stars, but had to shave off one for after closure wandering. When it hits midnight, people shouldn't be able to wonder to 2 different places that are closed. After midnight, let people finish what ever they're doing, partying and stuff, and then return back to their room, instead of wandering off to the farthest place in the hotel, so they don't even make it back to the room till after the ""new business day"" starts.",4,1,1.7.1
Kendall A.,"Its alright but the game sometimes crashes and you lose progress. Example: bought second double room, got the reward, game crashed, entered game and still had reward but not second double room anymore",3,1,2.3.3
A Google user,A fairly simple game that's easy to understand. The art style is charming and has even complication to keep me interested everytime I log on to collect my idle earnings. A very good mobile tycoon game that I hope to see even more updates from.,5,1,1.2.0
Ruhul Chowdhury,"It's an amazing game and I also love your other games but all my staff quit because I didn't pay them but the game didn't tell me how to pay them so could you add that to the tutorial at the beginning of the game? If you could that would be great. Other than that, great game and I really recommend it and their other games_",4,1,
Meet Gohil,"Good game but advertisement problem is there in new update please fix it , Some times advertisement doesn't come for long time soagain again I have to uninstall and install the game for the that come sometimes I watch the advertisement but doesn't get reward please fix this problems as soon as possible",4,1,2.2.1
Leanne Grimstead,Was loving the game and could even deal with the ads (you have to watch a lot of ads) but now the game has ran out of ads for me to watch which is ridiculous because now I can do hardly anything! I'm planning on uninstalling,2,1,1.9.8
A Google user,"This game is very interesting and addictive, but is problem with ads, there are too many ads and there's no skip button for ads, we have to wait for ads to complete, it's very irritating.",2,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"Gameplay is pretty fun. I would like to see updates to add upgrades to keep the hotel open longing when inactive. Upgrades for money earned while inactive, more ways to use the gold.",4,1,1.1.1
Ara Monfort,The ads suddenly dont load anymore. Its the faster way to earn money and that initiative is so helpful in this game and also the dancing man rarely appearing on my day 2 of playing. I might uninstall this game soon if this problem will not fix. My corihotel gained almost a million but in my 2nd hotel earned very slow bcos the ads and dancing man were not appearing anymore. Please take immediate action on this matter.,1,1,1.9.7
A Google user,At first I thought that this game was impossibal and that i would never be able to open other hotels and stuff. Thats not true. You just have to play often. Tip: The fancer and more upgraded things are the more money you will earn while your away,5,1,1.4.2
A Google user,"Funny game to kill your time. Mostly you can play it without ads or paying anything, but... Newest in-game event is definitely PAY TO WIN. There is no way that in 3 days you can reach 3 stars without paying, even 1 star seems impossible to get without paying. Very bad move Devs!.",2,1,1.4.0
Andres Romero,"Was good until they reset all of my progress during the event... I've built up the entire hotel, and now I have to start over? Lol you wish. The events are rigged to make you buy cash otherwise its impossible to get a reward 15 million in 3 days? Sure if you're on the game 24/7. Might just stop playing this game",2,1,1.8.4
Putu Sangging,"Nice game, eventhough it is not an educational game, yet we get some basic education for managing something. It is even more basic, but it is usefull. We may use for another type of small bussiness. I think I'm a but over exagerate",5,1,1.7.2

It says it pays you correctly during your absence but ive been off for 20 minutes and made over $400,000 and ive been off for 2 days and only made $200,000 so nope it doesnt pay correctly the last hotel doesnt pay right so you spend longer stuck on it thats a scam.",1,1,1.3.1

I never wanna stop playing.....EVER"" you should download this NOW",5,1,1.3.1
delna pinto,This game is fun to play and I will recommend you guys to play this game if you want a relaxing and chill game but there's a problem with this game there is always one housekeeper gets stuck in a same room everytime and the big problem is that if I clean the room by watching a video the housekeeper still be stuck there until I fired him but it keeps happening again and again so plz fix it that's why I am giving 4 stars to this game.,4,1,1.8.4

A Google user,"This new event is pointless & impossible to complete in 2 days unless you paid 10.99 for the perks. I am not, soooo that means this event won't be getting done at least by me smh. It's not easy to start off in the game & get things going. The VIP is cheap unless you're actually making money. This game has a way of cheating you. I watch these videos to double the income but only half (not double) goes to the hotel.... that is still happening. New hotels are needed not new impossible events.",1,1,1.4.2
A Google user,Playing the event hotel. Paid the vip package (i notmally dont pay to play games but thought why not.) Doing really well but at night i go to bed wake up 8 hours later open my hotel and it says its only been closed 2 hours and 48 mins everytime. I would have reached last star by now. Rip off paying money for the game to glich and not give me the reward.,1,1,1.4.2
yashika goel,This game is just insane.if you are free then only play this game. Its very addictive . there is just a issue when we complete our one hotel the profits generated in it can not be used in the other hotel. By which when a new hotel opens we face many problems.,4,1,1.8.4

A Google user,Good entertainment for an idle game. Would like to invest more time but the constant video issues have caused losses in the tens of thousands. Contacted tech support and no reply. Truly unfortunate.,3,1,1.2.0
Carolyn Poole,It is a good game to play with a friend but I was thinking maybe put two players in it so if your friend wants to play it you can just press the option of two players and then you would get more money in the game so that's what I'm thinking about more updates,5,1,2.3.1
A Google user,This game is awesome and very addictive. Ya it's slow a bit and you need to pay if you want to earn fast. The graphics are really good. All though I will like to see some more changes. But overall it's a good one.,4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,"I love this game very much, but i still don't get it, am playing game or watching ads? If you want to improve in the game u gotta watch ads every time .

It was fun at first but now is just aggravating",1,1,1.4.0
A Google user,Too many ads that really try to get you to but the $11 ad removal. If you do not watch the ads than it will take 500x longer. Good game if it wasn't for the ad push or the fact it will get old fast.,2,1,1.4.0

A Google user,"Loving it so far only been playin for a few hrs. I wish it let you click on unhappy people to get a better understanding why they arent happy.

Other then that in the few hrs ive played ive enjoyed myself.",4,1,1.2.0
A Google user,Would be a really nice game but has way too many ads. You have to watch them if you want to advance in the game at all. Upgrades to get rid of ads are really expensive. Honestly very disappointing,2,1,

A Google user,"It is funny watching nude men shower and sleep with other men sideby side in bed! I also like the humor in the hotel patron's faces going red while they sit on the toilet.

Andrew Burles,"Good until the reward ads stopped working. The ad doesn't play, the icon dissapears and no reward isn't given. This wouldn't be a huge concern if it weren't for the fact that ads are almost essential for getting your hotel profitable.",3,1,1.9.93
A Google user,This is a really good game I love it but the only thing I will change is turning around because you can't really rotate to see more and there also should be unlimited room space. Other than that it's the best game on my phone!!! ____,5,1,1.4.0
A Google user,I feel like this is the most realistic Idle game I've played. Personally it's fun to see growth of your hotels while keeping in mind the risks of payment and advertising. I really enjoy it,5,1,1.1.1

Aditya Noel Ignetto,All these tycoon games are an easy way for the developer to make money. The game is deliberately slow so we either pay for managers or watch ads either way they earn money.

Arianna Budd,I love these games. The only thing that is a bit irritating is that you have to wait to get more money in the game or watch the same ads over and over. It gets really old. I'm not spending $11 just for no adds ;). Other wise. Fun game!,4,1,1.8.4

A Google user,Overall the game is enjoyable. However having to pay $16.99 to get the final Presidential suite in the event hotel game leaves a bad taste. Fix it so one can pay with the hotel's earnings and I would happily give you 5 stars.,3,1,1.4.0
Aramis Hussung,I waited outside the app for almost 2 hours. When I turned it back on it acted as though not a single minute had passed. No profit at all. I'm glad I found this before I wasted anymore time on this garbage,2,1,1.7.2
Gabriel Salcedo,I love this game just in my game settings it shows that my volume is up and on my phone but no sound from game and I really hope you come out with more levels yes the events are great but I love to work on my hotels one at a time and I'm already almost on my last one more levels would be awesome TY.,5,1,1.9.7
A Google user,"This is an awsome game! I like the fact that even if the progress may be slow, you can still earn reasonable amounts of money without watching adds. This is a thing I don't see in games that often. Good job at making this game as it is, and I can only hope that in time it will become even better!",5,1,1.2.0
Cassandra Brown,Great game. Played a few levels. Need to watch a few ads to progress some are 5 seconds though. Otherwise it has great pace and is engaging.,5,1,1.7.2
A Google user,"Tried everything Doesn't appear that you can get past the first 2 hotels, as you need 9 stars to enter the 3rd hotel and there is no viable way to do this, I have written to support asking how one can achieve 5 stars within the 1st 2 hotels and have not received answer. I'm uninstalling this game and would not recommend downloading __",1,1,1.2.0
A Google user,Well its would be a 5 star game and I might of spent money on it but it would just be throwing money away on a game with only 4 hotels. All of them maxed out so very glad i never spent any money on it. Good game but in the end just not any length to it.,1,1,1.2.2

Sydney Couch,IF YOU GET ThIS GAME this game never buy something it riped me of for $12 I bought the event and never gave it to me and I went to the website to tell them and they never got back to me and I kept trying to get to them and they NEVER GOT BACK TO mE!!! So I recamend to look at other options before you get this game.(great game bad service),2,1,1.8.4
A Google user,Very nice game. Easy to play. And no major stress involved. Ads are profitable inside the game. Nice graphics with various of opportunities.,5,1,1.4.2

Aditya G,"Hello my name is Aditya. So for a couple of days I have been seeing that when I leave the app, the idle earning is generating the money but is not adding to my game account eventhough its saying already added. This makes it frustrating to play please look forward to removing this bug. Really not happy. Other than that the game is amazing. Pls requesting someone to give me a solution.",1,1,2.2.1

A Google user,Overall a good time killer. This game has been great to play on the side. However if you want to progress quicker you have to watch a TON of ads. I don't mind that too much but I'm sure there are people out there who do.,3,1,1.5.0

ladyluckleah_nz,My only complaint is that the money earned from your first hotel doesn't transfer between hotels. Once you have leveled up your first hotel and bought a new one...the old one is basically useless. Thats the only downside so far,4,1,1.8.4
A Google user,"To play this game, you need to watch 100s of ads otherwise it will take 3 years for you to build a new room. Also instructions unclear when I started the game I didn't understand why costumers were angry at the restraunt or what the numbers in the signs indicated. Ads also freeze In the middle.",3,1,1.2.0

Mary Kathryn Whitaker,"Fun game, wish hotel profits could be spread across all hotels. I maxed out the first hotel and racked up about $500k but there's nothing else to upgrade or purchase. So why not let me spend that on upgrades to new hotels? What's the point?",3,1,1.9.97
Daryoush Azimi,There's a bug which i can't close the upgrade options. But I love it. And earning money without watching ads is a little hard.,3,1,1.7.1
Hazed,"Brilliant idle game along with your prison game.only game where I'm fine with watching ads because it seems like you did something(bought the no ad thing anyway) My main problems are that 1.the people constantly go to things that are closed for example in the Arabian hotel as soon as I bought the stupid swimming pool now no one goes to my belly dance show, which is what makes so much",4,1,1.8.4
Dawn Dawn,"Loved it at first but once I got higher up, it glitches so much it shuts my phone off if I play more than a couple minutes. If they fix that I would download again but it's been going on for months",1,1,1.9.93
A Google user,Love the game. Some things that need fixing is how many hotels you get as well as the time for walks for guests/ employees takes way to long. As well as the time away doesnt add up with time frames and the money received.,4,1,1.2.1
A Google user,"The game is okay overall the graphics is cute and i like it 3 stars because i almost finish the game and no update yet, plus the span of the event is 3 and a half days so, how do we finish it in 3 and a half days, 15m is required 3 stars manager and just expect us to finish it in 3 and a days? and your VIP bundle is totally not worth it... i dont want to waste money for a 3 and a half days bundle and for event purposes. Seriously, i am okay with the ad but PLEASE! fix this event manager thing.",3,1,1.7.1
A Google user,"Very good considering other mobile games. This ones doesn't shove ads down your throat, it gives you the option to watch then for some other thing you want like money or bonuses.",5,1,1.1.1
The Bearded Baker,Would've given it 5 stars but an in game feature seems to have suddenly stopped. A chance to watch videos to gain financial rewards seems to have suddenly stopped with no explanation or even an update? Not good as it seems it may have been done on purpose to push in game purchases.,1,1,2.3.3
A Google user,This is actually really adtitive and its really fun and easy to play. The different hotels have always got something different that makes it better I have no bad comments apart from when you get free money I wish they would give you about 17 thousand rather ten 4 thousand for a 30 second video.,5,1,1.3.1
A Google user,"Hello I am a big fan of this game, but since the new upgrade, It keeps freezing and just not working, I have uninstalled and reinstalled but nothing has changed nothing is wrong, I have spent ¡ê10 and i feel its been for nothing? Is the game down at the moment?",5,1,0.3.0
Rh0dinte,This game is great over all I live playing it. I can play it all day. There really isn't anything I can't talk bad About this app but I wish I was easier to get stars in this game. I took me a while to gane 4 stars. I just wish it was little easier. Other than that this app is amazing great time spender.,4,1,1.8.1
A Google user,"Finished the game, and that's it. No replayability, nothing after the last hotel, nothing. Some games allow you to start over with bonuses on your next playthrough but nope",1,1,1.3.0
A Google user,Great gane. For anyone saying you dont make any money and you have to watch ads over and over. You dont. Be patient and you will make the money. You watch the ads IF YOU want to. You dont have to. Make more levels I've conpleted all 4 hotels!,5,1,1.2.2
chana gray,Been playing for awhile Bought vip experience for latest resort. Went through bank.. but never received it. D SHOWS n purchase history.. So tried Google play with my play credit. .

steph ¡°lux¡± tout,the game is great they have ads you can watch to boost profit only once you click on the ad the only way to close it is to close the entire game and so this function can not be used which mean not double profits unless you wont to spend extra money,2,1,1.8.4

nick cella,"cute,fun, addictive, but the problem is, even that I have upgraded one hotel to 5 star hotel, there's always a customer who doesn't happy for the service like in the restaurant everything was fully upgraded that should let as unlimited guest and not limited to 6 customers only.",4,1,1.8.4

Jamie Sullivan,"I really, really enjoyed this game... until I finished it! There are only 4 hotels, and it only took me a few weeks to fully upgrade all of them.

TylerR071,"Game is fun and a little addicting. Only complaint is I watch the ad to double my money when I return to the app, but it doesn't actually double my money... kinda annoying when I could bring in 20k+ from doing it which isn't that bad of money..",4,1,1.8.1
A Google user,Great gameplay with fair ad placement that doesn't feel like you need to spend money to get anywhere. Ad rewards are fair and short. Only reason it wasn't a five star is because a specific ad that seems to take priority for free cash refuses to play thus refuses to give you the cash.,4,1,1.1.1
chris marisic,This is not a game. It is an advertisement viewing portal. There is no game play. The game starts you off with a hotel that loses more money than it brings in. The only way to profit is to watch advertisements. This is a hard ZERO / 10.,1,1,1.7.1

I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what to do and by the time it reached 16 minutes, I gave up because I didn't want to spend an hour trying to do the start of a game.

Devan Barrett,Installed game went to open and all I get is connection error code -1. Have 4G access and even connected to home WiFi. Not sure what the deal is. Uninstalled and reinstalled same issue.,1,1,1.7.1
A Google user,Really fun game. Attentive Dev and an interesting twist on the basic idle tycoon formula. My only issues is the lack of content but I am sure that will be sorted soon.,4,1,0.3.1
A Google user,Really fun and enjoyable. Little pop culture references to keep things entertaining and no pressure/need to spend money to keep things progressing.,5,1,1.4.2
Gypsy Charm,Its great when you buy ad free. I had an issue starting the game and devs replied as soon as it was fixed. Im overall satisfied with the game and service.,5,1,1.8.4
_R_ Official,"This game is suck.They force us to spend real money to get vip and special manager.If you dont spend your real money,you need to watch so many ads so you can have money to upgrade stuff.The first hotel is the easiest but once you get the second hotel,the price and the income are not fair.The price is too expensive especially the wage of workers.",1,1,
A Google user,it is a great game good for when your at work and you need like a 5 minute break I just wish money from old business's would carry over but that might break the progression for each hotel. defenity make more of this game,4,1,1.1.1
A Google user,"All the other reviews say the same thing; and that is there's nothing to do with earned money once you've maxed out a hotel. I understand not wanting to make it too easy for us to complete other hotels, but then why not just make the prices higher while still allowing the money to carry over? Why not give the earned money from the other hotels some purpose even if there's no more advantage than without it carrying over like it is now? All in all, the current state of this game is pointless imo.",3,1,1.3.0
A Google user,Waiting for weeks to play more but no new hotels to build so basically a waste of space. Finished all levels in about 3 weeks since then nothing to do and no update!,2,1,1.2.2
Willibum Wason,A few months back i had a 5 star because i completed the entire game in a month with 20million dollars in the last resort. Since i took a break for so many months is because i completed the game. I came back today and all my stats were reset. 1 star. Nothing else.,1,1,1.8.4
Juju Rodriguez,"I rate this 5 stars cuz __ iT hAVES this glitch that the rich man offers you like ""107 example"" dollers but after the ad it give you like ""1407 example"" dollers instead 107 but this makes the game soooo much faster LOL buttttt its a good mobile game if your bord or going somewhere and have nothing to do so yeah but its funny this is the glitch but i only saw this in the starter hotel Maybe its gone if you saw this oof",5,1,1.9.8
A Google user,It's an okay game. It takes way to long to progress. But i'll give it a chance and see how it develops. It lacks the charm and the content of your other games though. I'll see how I feel as the game progresses.,3,1,1.1.0
A Google user,Nice Game with some fun details. The upgrading of the facilities feels satisfying and at some point the rewards get a boost so reaching 5 stars becomes fairly easy.,4,1,1.3.1
Avinash Saraff,Fun game. But similar complaints as others. Too many ads to watch to get your hotel going. And can't transfer money from established hotels. Gave up after 1st 5star hotel and a big more,2,1,1.7.1
A Google user,"Been playing for a little while , it's hard if you dont do things correctly which is what I like about it , and theres always something to do. Love how this is different than all the other clicker games (kinda a clicker game?) Enjoy this",4,1,1.2.1
A Google user,It has a lot of ads which helps you to get profit. I am gladly watching ads just to get more money so that I can play this game for free. You have an option to pay or watch ads... I prefer ads :),5,1,1.2.0

A Google user,the game is slow and the multipler you have to watch 12 times to get max multiplier. it also took like 10 min to download and i was so bored i had to watch a show.also it automaticaly deleted its self and I just quit because it took to long.,2,1,

Jerimia Inkiriwang,not very often I played this kind of game more than 2 minutes. probably I just miss my work as a hotelier (thanks to this pandemic). but this game kept me playing for days now.. good work.

Pau Mas Abad,"This is by far the best hotel management game but at the same its plenty of ads and business just for the fu**ing patron, which gives you a misery of fake money. Sometimes it bugs itself, you see the as and you don't recieve what they have promised. The most important: while you are suffering to get a single room in the last hotel that you earned in the other your making 80k with two hours!",1,1,

A Google user,Its a new angle to ''clicker tycoon'' games. I like it. I love the references. The dude that helps you in the beginning is the receptionist from the hotel in John Wick and the general manager you can purchase is the owner of the hotel in John Wick.

A Google user,"As a player, this games is quiet disapointing.Actually the fact that it's dissapointing is that when you leave or exit the game either you stop earning money or you just stop.What I mean by stop is that you will lose all of your money and its like starting all over again.I mean im a very picky person so people will disagree with me.Also things are really hard to buy for instins the double rooms cost 1,000 dollars and it is hard to get money.Looking for a game like life.......Well here you are.",2,1,1.7.1

A Google user,This game has a great concept but it's like impossible to earn the amount of money they expect of you without waiting forever and it caused my phone to lag terribly I had to remove the game to even functionally use my phone.,1,1,

Michael Annino,"Game wouldn't progress past the loading screen even after a restart! I sat through all the ""hints"" so many times that I was beginning to memorize them. There wasn't even a loading progress bar to show if the game was doing anything! Uninstalling and looking for a different game.",1,0,3.1
Addison Killmeyer,"The game looked very interesting and it was fun at first. But then the game kept freezing then crashing over and over again. So I would lose progress on what did so would have to restart and earn my money back. The other part that after I crash I would lose most of my money which was really annoying because it was harder to upgrade things. Since I couldn't upgrade things, I couldn't make more money.",2,0,
Homar Castillo,"The game is good has. a lot of potential but the problem is that their is a lot of bugs. One bug is that even if you're not scrolling the screen the game starts to glitch and stuff starts to glitch out. And the second is that when I try to open it, all of sudden it tells me it can't be opened. I hope the problems I listed get fix and fast because I enjoy this game.",3,0,1.7.2
A Google user,"Overall the game isn't bad, but too easy to beat (less than 2 weeks for me). Some of the ads also stick and I've had the game freeze several times. But, overall, not bad... Just needs to have more game playability/variety and more control (such as an option to set open and close times, variety or specialize the rooms, etc).",4,0,1.2.0
Miriam Larson,"One of the best games I've played. The graphics are amazing, the controls are easy best of all It's a game that takes some work. It's not a game where you can finish it in one day. The thing that needs improvement is it would be amazing if you could transfer money from other hotels and vice versa other than that I would definitely recommed this game.",4,0,1.7.2
A Google user,Nice time waiters. Edited: had to drop two stars. The Christmas lvl increses the price of all upgrades and lowers the return on all of the investments. It took weeks to finish that level without spending any actual money. Then the Arabian hotel increases/decreases everything even further. Sadly it stopped being fun. Plus their is no incentive to keep hotels open after you have purchased all of the upgrades.,2,0,1.3.1
A Google user,"Its a really good game and addictive, I even paid to remove ads. I was wondering if you guys could hear a suggestion I have about it though. I was wondering if it would be ok for us to use the money we make from one hotel for the other, or like to make some sort of ""money transfer"" to make it seem more realistic. Its fund and all starting from new but I feel like it would make the game more interesting instead of having to forget about one hotel while working on the other besides that great app.",5,0,1.2.0
Carter Emory,"Rather tedious experience. You can play the game normally, but the exponential growth in profits on your hotels doesn't happen until the levels are almost already max upgraded, which is...just bad design, IMO. The point of a Tycoon game is to be able to continue building up your empire or business, not reach a halt at the end of it. Ads are plagued across this game, as well as micros that are intentionally trying to make you spend too much money on things that don't feel fairly priced.",3,0,
Jessica Russo,"This is the best Idle Tycoon game out there. You actually get to buy things to make your hotels nicer and more amenities which adds a really interactive element. Most games you don't get to customize whatever the Tycoon is like a hotel, restaurant or airport. You just save enough money for the next level to get unlocked then you wait for the money to unlock another level. They get boring fast but this game keeps your interest as you save up to buy pools, better beds, more staff, etc. 5 stars!",5,0,
A Google user,"There's some basic balance issues in the game right now with early income to upgrade costs. Also upon unlocking a new location, the game implies all your money is shared as a cumulative total across all locations. That's not the case however, so upon completely upgrading one hotel, all the income from that's becomes useless because it just accrues on that map and isn't able to be spent elsewhere.",3,0,1.1.1
Calisha Prince,"Pretty fun so far. Still on my first hotel and the dancing man doesn't work all the time. He'll definitely go away when I send him out, but the videos only play sometimes. I also tried skipping night and that didn't work either. However as others have said, I'm glad I'm not pressured to spend money to level up and the graphics are nice on the eyes",4,0,1.7.2
Loony Toons,"There is a very tiny problem but still kinda annoying,when I get off the game for say like an hour and I come back the cheffs are already coming into the restaurant when it's been open for some time then before they even hit the table to get cooking the restaurant closes and all those people are asked out furthermore there is an issue with the rewards after an add... I don't know if it's just the wifi but the video will load every once in a great while but other times I've watched a black bufer",4,0,1.7.1
Alexis Danielle,"Could have been fun but it just became stressful because the balance between how much you earn and how much you pay for upgrades was off by a lot, and the ads didn't help at all either because the reward it gives is so little and the amount you pay for upgrades is much higher. Took me about a week but when I finally started the second hotel somehow I was already in debt from a restaurant that wasn't even running and no one would visit so I just stayed in debt and never moved forward",3,0,
A Google user,"To do almost anything you have yo pay 10 dollars. And. It's not a single purchase, there at least like 3. And then there are the gems, another moneygrab. And what isn't locked behind those 2 things you need to watch an ad for, each of which is at least 30 seconds, and this means that if you don't spend at least 10 dollars or so you spend most of your time watching ads. And to get everything which you would think would be part of the game itself, like it actually being an idle game, you pay more.",1,0,
Syd DD.,"This is a fun game, I don't even hate the ads. The annoying part is that the money you make in one hotel doesnt transfer to the new one so you'll just have millions of dollars wasting away after your hotel has been upgraded to the max and be dirt poor for the new one which is pretty disappointing. Other than that, its fun.",4,0,1.7.1
A Google user,"Definitely addicting! This game is a total time waster, yet challenging. You do not have to pay a dime to be successful, ads are the key and opening up every 2 hours or so to reap the rewards. The Event Hotels plus managers is exciting as well. Nearly complete with the final hotel. Looking forward to more. Plenty of reviewers have dropped great upgrade suggestions. Definitely want more hotels, more guests in the restaurant and casino. Currently have 5 managers. Ready to ball out!!",4,0,
A Google user,"Fun while it lasted. So, it's just the 5 hotels? I was enjoying it, even spent $11, then the game just ended, can't even replay. No new challenges. That's disappointing __. Ok, so these events are even worse. Just 4 days and you literally have to spend money if you want to be at all competitive. It's just a cash grab now. Come out with real, new content and I will play again and even spend money here and there. Reduced from 3star to a 2 star because if the new event structure",2,0,1.3.1
A Google user,"It's too slow to accumulate money to do anything. I waste $3,000 on a double room and the profit per hour is less than $4? The payment for watching an advertisement is less than $1,000? The whole energy thing is so stupid. So, I have to waste $2,500 to receive 5 energy? Great, now what can I do with that!? For previous games, they've kept me attentive. I'll lose interest in this game, mainly because the only thing I can do is watch advertisements. It's not fun. I would not recommend this game.",1,0,1.1.1
Damien Zinn,"You can get x2 money without watching the ads! After you have already entered the app once and received your money from being offline (you must watch the video here ot get the 2x profits) you must close out of the app. Then go back into the app. Once you've gotten in, select where you'd go to watch the videos for 2x profits as fast as you can and spam the button until the bar is full. You can only do this after already having opened the app a first time and closing the app out.",4,0,1.7.1
Hailey Smith,"Not bad, enjoyed playing it. Sometimes the event hotels are a little unrealistic unless you buy something to boost or help you. Very sad that another hotel hasnt popped out, but since ive played them all not much to do. Still have not seen signs that another hotel will be coming out possibly one on the water, or certain rooms on the water instead of one building. Or maybe a garden area to add instead of the same sauna or pool. Idk but it was good while it lasted",4,0,
A Google user,"Lately there have been a lot of Matchington Mansion Ads playing when I go to watch the ads to double the money, or for the money man, or any reason to watch the ads, and then I watch the full ad and go to close it, it wont close until I agree to lose the reward. And it is getting quite frustrating.",3,0,1.3.1
A Google user,"Heavily dependant on ads and in-app purchases, it's possible to play but only after watching 10+ ads in a row or one every minute or so. The reward for watching isn't enough, it's very penny pinching and takes forever to progress, you're literally fed ads more than you play the actual game and I know I've said it already mutiple times. Don't waste your time with it. The max idle time is 2 hours which isn't really idle at all just so you come back to watch ads again.",1,0,
A Google user,It's okay so far I'll edit when I get more into the game. EDIT Currently on the second hotel for about three days now and officially BORED. If you want to get anywhere in the game you have to watch ads or pay for things. If you leave the game for awhile and come back after a few hours and watch a video it doesn't double your profit. It takes so long to get anywhere in this game and starting to become very frustrating.,2,0,1.2.0
A Google user,"amazing and fun game. i hand many props to the developers for making the game independent from in app purchases; meaning you dont need to buy anything to progress in the game. even if you did, the prices are fair! i love this game and its super satisfying to keep customers happy and use money wisely. the graphics are great and is a super cute style. my only concern is the lazy duplication of rooms when doing the other side of the hotel and people walking through walls and furniture.",5,0,
Sammy,"This game is extremely unbalanced. For starters, none of the free rewards in this game actually work. My assumption is unless you pay for it, you don't get it. Secondly, watching an ad to get rewards also doesn't work. You're just watching a minute long ad for nothing. Thirdly, why the heck do additional items cost electricity?? Extremely annoying game. Do not recommend if you have high blood pressure.",1,0,3.1
night shift,Fun game but... the house keepers don't always clean the rooms which I was thinking is a bug however since they have an ability to watch an ad to clean the rooms I'm guessing this is on purpose. I absolutely hate ads that ruin productivity in a simulation / management game. Because of this one forced ad I won't be paying for the game or giving this company any money.,1,0,3
Richard Alexie,Don't get money for ads anymore. Multiplayer after watching ad doesn't work anymore. I watch the ad and never get a bonus after getting to the second hotel. It makes it less fun to play when you watch a 30 second ad and no bonus from it.,1,0,3.1
Tamica Stalder,"NO REWARDS FOR WATCHING ADS. Sometimes you will get your reward for watching ads, but mostly no reward. It will also allow you to watch an entire ad then freeze the game up to where you have to back out completely and reload the game..",1,0,3.1
Jonathan Pearce,"Not a bad game however plays on you to use either big cash or videos, I coose videos however 4 out of 10 don't give the reward most of the time the big ones, need to fix this as I've watched the ad, also, offer guy disappears every 2 or 3 vids without offering a deal. Feel like this is a con vid game to get money out of the players without paying them out",3,0,3.1
Fuad Al Asad,"The game is fun. One issue is that the offers and ads are too big and really can be frustrating when they take a huge part of the screen. If they can allocate some place, that would be good. The same goes for the ads. Thank you.",3,0,3.1
miss ice queen 2,I really like the game but when I have chefs the wage for them is twice or three times and it makes progress a lot slower because I lose money to the restaurant because I have to pay 1200 instead of 400 for their pay it's been months and it still hasn't been resolved I really like the game but this makes it so much worse,4,0,3
Moist Flower,"Downloaded the game 30 mins ago and already got flipped off 5 times, when you watch ads it takes you out the game and doesn't even give you the reward. would've been a cooler game if ad removal was cheaper and you actually got your rewards for watching the ads this dumb scam of a game is produced by. Just another game where they don't care about the quality of the game they only care about the money they get from ads. Welcome to mobile gaming I guess",1,0,3.1
Razor Gray,"Ads don't work most of the time, I watch the investor every single time I get him but only get the rewards around 1 out of 10 times, sometimes less, I would give 5 stars if this was fixed since me watching ads willingly puts money in the Devs pocket but I'm not getting the promised rewards and wasting my time.",3,0,3.1
Brandon,Amazing game I love how the stars aren't so easy to get you have to actually put in work and not just spam buy items but one this I hate is that when you get like 5 thousand and It forces you to get something I know that the game wants to help us but I would love for there to be an option to not do the tutorial or have to buy what they want but overall 5 stars ______,5,0,3.1

Once again thank Codigames and please make more fun games. :):],5,0,3

Dawn Rossignol,"Great game! I love playing this game its fun upgrading rooms. hiring and firing people is great as well, wish there was more amenities to add onto the hotels.

It's made it impossible to play, which is irritating. Oh, and I think the separated money between hotels is nice. Sure, it makes you have to start off with barely any money for every new hotel, but at least the prices for everything are about the same as the last hotel. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my 5-star hotel money that I can't spend.",4,0,2.8

Also maybe add really expensive items to save up your money for after fully upgrading every hotel, for example a gold statue worth a few million to put in your hotel or something like that.

Zach Shald,"While this game can be fun sometimes, the progression is just slow. It feels like you need to buy or watch an ad (10 min 2X?!) to get further in the game.

I played this game until a few days into third hotel.. after spending untold hours spent in a week, to actually make enough money to make progress you have to continuously click on the ads to get cash from these VIP investors. Think this was a lost opportunity- a few mini games for these moments would of been better, even if still need to do these adds, they could find a balance.",2,0,

A Google user,"The game itself was fun to play, there's a few practical efficiency issues stunting growth in the later hotels. It was great to pay for features that worked. Unlike other click bait paid features on other games. It wasn't great that there are only 5 hotels and being the 5th and last it lacked originality. It was basically the same layout as the 1st but added a disco. Boring. This game had potential but I feel this is just an app to collect data for something new. Thanks developers",3,0,1.2.1

A Google user,It was a nice idea and it looked good but it was incredibly boring. Everything was priced too high so I was forced to watch the ads in order to do basically anything.

I rarely make reviews when I'm unhappy with a game but this one was throughly disappointing.,1,0,
Darius Stahl,I paid for the premium version of the game and absolutely loved it. Although at Santa's Resort and Arabian Nights Resort whenever I logged into the game there was no money made.

A Google user,A very fun game if it wasn't for the extremely slow progression. True idle games let you progress quickly through the game but you have to watch copious amounts of adverts to progress; they are optional but if you wany any real chance of getting to a double room you need those ads. Prices are also very unbalanced with a single battery (5 power) costing 2500 money??,2,0,

A Google user,Only 2 hotels or levels. In app purchases for x2 earnings/no adds over ¡ê10 and extended offline earnings over ¡ê5. Sells packages for massive amounts of diamonds yet even if purchased could not spend anywhere near the amount being sold. Previous hotel income not taken into account for new hotel. Crashes a lot and lot of missed rewards for videos. They say in testing still but if that's the case don't offer items for sale. Seems like quick cash grab app. Good concept expanding on normal idle apps,2,0,0.3.1
A Google user,"Very nice game, though at the beginning you get a lot of your income by watching ads.

Gaurang Joshi,The game is really very nice. I used to play the University tycoon game and it was also very good. The only issue is the ads. The amount shown to be given after watching the ad and the amount given after the ad are always different. Please resolve this issue and this game might get a lot better.,3,0,
A Google user,Please developers make this game has better development curves. There's no way i can upgrade things normally without clicking on ads. Its literally forcing me to watch ads so that i can progress. Everything is so damn expensive and the money added earned from upgrading things are just not worth it. I love the concept but the progression is too slow. 2 days. Thats all the time it have on my phone,3,0,1.2.0
A Google user,Tried this game and did not like it. Maybe it's just me but when I get messages in game the words need to flow correctly I can't play a game where the translation to english doesn't make sense.

Chris Deel,"I really enjoy the game, but was wondering if there will be more hotels to work with besides the weekend event ones, as I've gotten through all the existing hotels thus far.

A Google user,It's an okay game. Too many ads for my liking and it needs to have more to it. Maybe like different colors or furniture or other things to add into the hotel. It's a virtual game so you can put anything you want into it if its given to you.,3,0,1.2.0
A Google user,Just started playing and not too bad. There are adds to watch stuff but they are given as a choice and so don't really cause any problems.

A Google user,"Game is pretty straight forward, offers simple fun. Graphics are decent, concept is ok. It becomes a grind, no choices to make just plow forward until everything is upgraded.

Not a big worry, just means you have to grind longer.",3,0,1.2.2
Britni Houchin,Its a fun game but ads stop paying out once you hit second hotel. Have to restart game almost every time dude walks in. If Im watching ads for bonus dollars I want the dollars.

Konstantina Pant,I love it. I love that per hotels everything is different the guests etc. But having to click multiple objects per room to upgrade it and having 60 rooms is terrible.

Matthew Jones,"Ads ads ads... This game had so much potential but its absolutely littered with ads, it's basically an afk game.

Mikhail Kozub,Its a very fun game. Giving 2 stars because they purposely make it so you can not advance to the 3rd hotel without spending money. You have to collect 9 stars to get the 3rd hotel and the only way possible is to buy more gems. I was really enjoying the game and even the ads aren't to bad.

A Google user,I have always loved designing & visualizing growth in the way that this game provides. It's been fun!! I would like it if the game offered a 2nd optional savings account to keep some of ur money separated in case u accidentally over spend & still need to pay ur employees.

A Google user,Beautiful game with beautiful animation. The best management game ever played so far. Only one thing I don't like which is choping sound that coming from kitchen its way too loud & makes uncomfortable to hear after certain times. If developer see this please remove & add some other kitchen sound instead of choping. Thanks,5,0,1.3.1
A Google user,This app drains my battery very quickly and my phone gets warm to the touch. None of my other games do this. Watching an ad only gives you 10 mins of double revenue.

A Google user,Quite a poor game. Theres so much you need to do and you dont have enough money to do so unless you keep watching ads. Great concept and I would keep playing if it wasnt so difficult to get money and advance in anyway. I suggest fixing this if you want more people to play.,2,0,1.0
A Google user,Good at the start. The games gets better and better with more and more items and things to upgrade as you through hotel 1-3. However you then get to 4 and it is just a re-skin of 1 with more rooms. Was really hoping for more. They should add a 5th+ hotel,4,0,1.2.1
Colton Kosicek,Great and entertaining game but too short. I really enjoyed playing but beat it within a month. They need to create better pathing for guests on later levels. Food Halls are too small so you lose on a lot of profit until you get past the bar and food activities.,5,0,1.7.1

A Google user,I mean its a great game. Worth the whole 10 dollars in game i paid for no ads and can just claim double on anything. It just gets boring after a while i got to the third hotel and just got bored waiting.somw of the upgrade prices are just not realistic to me.,3,0,1.2.2
A Google user,It was alright. It was fun at first but restarting at every hotel was really annoying. I get it but it is frustrating to raise the prices for everything at every new hotel but not give a good income raise. Takes forever to get to the last hotel and then I just quit.,3,0,
A Google user,I really liked this game. The game play was fun and easy. What made me delete the app is that it was impossible to get five stars for either of the two hotels I had. I had everything levelled up to the max and I still only had four stars on both hotels. Eventually I got frustrated and got rid of the app.,3,0,
Jaea De Vera,"not the game like in the ads. You can't rearrange furnitures in a room. The interface are a little confusing. The moneys are slow paced. It has a nice concept and all, I'm just not satisfied with how slow the game is. BUT THE CONCEPT ARE GOOD! Please keep it",2,0,

Harjot Bakshi,"One of the worst part of the game is that the way you accumulate money is incredibly low even there's no use of ads coz it will not earn you any money, most of the time the ads only conver the wages of the employees.

It took me 2 days with countless hours and ads to complete the one hotel and things become even more difficult when I'm in next level. I'll pass this one there are far better games.",1,0,

A Google user,Very Addicting game! Only gripe is once you max a hotel out and move to the next the old one becomes useless.

Kayla Kocielko,Since the new hotel the ads for extra money from the special guy doesn't work so you can't get the money for it and end up having no staff because you're stuck at like 50 bucks for the hotel.. it would be better if the funds from one hotel could transfer because otherwise the hotels keep making money no reason. Like the first one has a million earned but the new one has 50 earned. In order to keep your game going it seems like you HAVE to pay money for the add-ons with the new level,2,0,1.7.1
A Google user,"Cute enough. No real incentive to sit in the game. But no forced ads either. Events, as far as I can tell, are impossible to win unless you pay real money. *Maybe* if you sat in the app 24/7 watching ads and collecting tips, you *might* win. But totally not worth the time.",3,0,1.7.1

Joshua Tam,"The game is not an ""idle game"" there is nothing earned when offline. Other hotels stop collecting money at 3k unless you go to visit them and just sit there while it operates.

I wouldn't mi d the adds so much if they were worth it. are there going to be more hotels besides this handful? I'm on the last one. other than that, I find this a nice little time killing game.",3,0,1.7.4
Dawn Pereira,I played for 24 hours. I really thought it was going to be a good game. I could watch ads to speed up some things and get some cash.

Joanne Green,"Don't waste your time. The first two hotels are great. You watch videos to get money and a man comes where you watch a video and he gives you sums of money, but as you move onto other hotels the costs of rooms, facilities, etc are absolutely stupid. You are looking at 14,000,000 the cost of a room in hotel number 5 and you only start off with one room as an oppose to the others with 5. It's impossible to make money. It clearly wants you to buy money as time goes on and I'm not prepared to.",2,0,1.7.2

Matt Hughes,Great idea for a cool game but the developer is money hungry and doesn't understand what realistic monitization is for a game like this. Any of the permanent upgrades offer cost 10.99 which is entirely too much for an idle game. The in game $ boost is only for ten minutes for a 30 to 60 second ad. Worthless. The ad based money boosts are pitiful and worthless. Plenty of other similar games out there with much less greedy devs. @the devs. Being less greedy will make you more money!,2,0,
A Google user,The game would be better if it wasn't so laggy and slow other than that the graphics are really just great for a phone game and it seems like it would be really fun I just would love to be able to find out instead of waiting 5+ minutes just for someone to check in,3,0,1.3.1

A Google user,Enjoyable and addictive. Purchasable items are way too expensive. Needs an option to use gems for the skip upgrades. People are more likely to spend gems than 10$ for an upgrade. Even of it's the same thing. Gems will be spent better than actual money,4,0,1.2.0

Gevin Steed,"Gotta say, I got bored after one day of playing. Once you learn that each hotel is basically the same as the previous, it gets repetitive. After you 5-star your hotel, there's no point in playing anymore. You can't do anything with the money that hotel is making anyway.",2,0,1.7.1
